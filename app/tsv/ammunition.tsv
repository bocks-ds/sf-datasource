2	Battery	<p>Batteries charge powered weapons, but they can also be used to power an array of items, including powered armor and technological items. Batteries have a standardized size and weight, and items that take batteries all have a slot into which they fit, regardless of the item&rsquo;s actual size. Weapons that use batteries list the highest-capacity battery they are capable of using as well as how many charges from the battery that each shot consumes.</p>	1	60	20	null	null	CRB	190
3	Darts	<p>These light metal shafts each have a pointed tip and a reservoir to hold toxins or other appropriate substances that are typically liquid or viscous. While most combatants rely on darts to deliver toxins to enemies, particularly desperate or overworked field medics sometimes employ darts to conveniently deliver antitoxins, healing serums, and other beneficial drugs across a crowded battlefield. In these cases, medics often practice to improve their aim to ensure that this strategy is effective when employed.</p>	1	20	25	L	null	CRB	190
4	Flare	<p>Usually made of magnesium, flares burn brightly and can deliver some heat. You can ignite a flare by hand without the need for a flare gun. A lit flare burns for 1 hour, and it can be wielded in melee combat as an improvised weapon that deals 1d2 fire damage.</p>	1	5	1	null	null	CRB	190

10	Kishalee Battery	<p>Roughly the same size as standard batteries, kishalee batteries are translucent cylindrical objects bound by a transparent aluminum alloy. By a strange quirk of fate and parallel engineering, kishalee batteries can be interchanged with the standard batteries used among the Pact Worlds and beyond, but these rare batteries allow a creature to use and kishalee artifacts with greater efficiency. If placed in non-kishalee items, a kishalee battery functions like a standard battery. The technology for rapid recharging of a kishalee battery has been lost, but such batteries recharge themselves automatically over the course of 24 hours of disuse.<br />These batteries come in four different varieties: normal, high-capacity, super-capacity, and ultra-capacity. Each variety has a maximum number of charges as the normal batteries of the same type (Starfinder Core Rulebook 179). When these batteries are found, they are almost always fully charged.</p>	2	400	20	null	null	DS05	41

21	Explosive Arrow	<p>Explosive ammo is used with projectile weapons and is available for most projectile weapons and other weapons that fire arrows and darts, as noted on Table 1&ndash;8. A weapon firing explosive ammo deals its normal amount of damage, but half of this damage is fire damage and grants the weapon the knockdown critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, the knockdown critical hit effect is added and considered part of the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect. If the weapon normally already has the knockdown critical hit effect, it instead gains the push (5 feet) critical hit effect in addition to knockdown, and this considered part of the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect.</p>	2	75	20	L	Fiery	ARM	55

28	Grenade Arrow I	<p>The explosive tip of the arrow detonates on impact. A grenade arrow can be made using any handheld grenade. The miniaturized technology incorporated into the arrow increases its price substantially over an equivalent grenade.</p>	6	875	1	null	As any 1st-level grenade	CRB	190
29	Phasing I Longarm And Sniper Rounds	<p>This ammunition is tipped with quantum-variable molecules, allowing it to phase through many materials prior to impacting with its target. If you take a move action to aim and then fire on the same turn a weapon with phasing ammo (including doing so with a sniper weapon), the attack ignores any cover the target has with a hardness equal to given value or less (hardness 10 for 7th-level rounds, hardness 20 for 14th-level rounds). The rounds literally bypass the cover, doing no damage to it.</p>	7	820	25	L	null	ARM	55

31	Tactical Missile	<p>Explosives have the explode special property, which lists the amount of damage the explosion deals, the damage type, special effects (with a duration, if necessary), and the radius of the explosion. When you attack with this type of weapon or ammunition, aim at a grid intersection. Each creature within the blast radius takes the listed damage but can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. If the explode special property has any special effects other than damage, they are negated with a successful saving throw. Some exploding weapons, such as smoke grenades, don&rsquo;t deal damage, so they don&rsquo;t include the damage and damage type entries.</p>	10	5700	1	1	Explode 6d8 B & P (30 ft.)	CRB	190
32	Plasma Missile, Ionized	<p>Compatible with any weapon that can use missiles as ammunition, plasma missiles deal additional damage beyond even their analog counterparts, and come with an increased price tag to match.

33	Arrows, Diamond-Edge	<p>For those who want to deal greater damage with a bow but don&rsquo;t want the noise and collateral damage of grenade arrows, conventional arrows are available with technological improvements to deal additional damage, including diamond-edge and molecular rift arrows. When used as ammunition for weapons other than the 1st-level bow (such as crossbolters), these arrows don&rsquo;t increase damage, but diamond-edge arrows gain the wound critical hit effect and molecular rift arrows gain the severe wound critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the effect granted by the arrow.</p>	12	5200	20	L	4d6 P	ARM	55
