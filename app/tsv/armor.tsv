These displays can be controlled via a personal comm unit or a more advanced computer. The glow emitted by the suit when displaying such patterns isn’t bright enough to provide useful illumination, but it does reveal the wearer’s position in darkness or dim light.</p>	light	3	1350	3	3	5	0	0	0	L	ARM	68

Each suit of shiftskin is designed to accommodate both its owner’s natural form and one other specific assumed form of another race, shifting and reshaping as needed when the reptoid changes shape. Thus a suit of shiftskin can be adjusted to accommodate two different forms (Core Rulebook 196), rather than fitting only one form at a time.<br/> Shiftskin has been adapted for use by other races. Even when used by non-reptoids, an individual suit can still can be adapted to shift between two different forms, so long as those forms are no more than one size category apart. Though obviously of use for non-reptoid shapeshifters, this also allows the same suit to fit two different wearers.</p>	light	9	13850	10	11	7	1	0	2	1	ARM	71
