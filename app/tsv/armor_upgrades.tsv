1	Weapon Spikes	<p>A suit of armor covered in wicked spikes is an iconic piece of devourer cultist gear. You can add a one-handed basic melee weapon of light or negligible bulk to your armor to act as weapon spikes. You pay 125% of the cost of the selected basic melee weapon to add it as an upgrade. You must have a hand free to attack with the weapon spikes (so you can maneuver a foe into a position where the spikes are effective), unless the foe is grappling you or you are grappling the foe (in which case you can attack with the weapon spikes even if you do not have a free hand). You can also make attacks with weapon spikes when pinned, though only against the creature pinning you.</p>	null	null	1	Heavy, powered	Varies	DS02	53
2	Agility Enhancer, Mk 1	<p>This upgrade consists of replacing the hard corners of armor with more expensive flexible materials carefully angled and reinforced to increase mobility without sacrificing protective values. Agility enhancers reduce the armor check penalty of your armor, to a minimum of 0. Some agility enhancers apply only to Acrobatics, while others apply to any skill affected by armor check penalties. The amount depends on the agility enhancer type, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 1):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 1 for Acrobatics.<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 5):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 1 for all skills.<br/> <strong>Mk 3 (Level 9):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 2 for Acrobatics.<br/> <strong>Mk 4 (Level 13):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 2 for all skills.<br/> <strong>Mk 5 (Level 17):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 3 for Acrobatics.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	1	375	1	Light, heavy	L	ARM	80
3	Aversion Coating	<p>This small module secretes a terrible-tasting chemical compound. The aversion coating grants you gain a +2 bonus to AC against bite attacks. If you are subject to the swallow whole universal creature rule, the swallowing creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 15 + the armor’s level) or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the creature is sickened for 1d6 rounds instead.</p>	1	200	1	Light, heavy	null	NSP	152
4	Concealed Compartments	<p>This upgrade consists of many hidden compartments that are difficult to distinguish from the armor’s surface. Your armor grants you a +5 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks when hiding items on your body. You can store up to 1 bulk worth of items in your concealed compartments.</p>	1	175	1	Any	L	ARM	82
5	Descent Thrusters	<p>Developed by kasathan engineers long ago to help them navigate the steep cliffs of their native Kasath, descent thrusters are miniature jets that slow your fall. You fall at a rate of only 60 feet per round, and you take no damage upon landing. You can trigger decent thrusters as part of an action when jumping down, or as a reaction if you fall.</p>	1	800	1	Any	L	PWD	197
6	Easy Access Kit	<p>This set of mechanical supports and electric connectors allows you to install a single technological item with light or negligible bulk on your wrist or another easily accessible body part. Installing or swapping out a technological item attached to the upgrade requires 10 minutes, as though you were swapping out an armor upgrade. Whenever at least one of your hands is free, you can use the item as though it were in your hand. If the item  normally requires two hands to use, you still need two free hands to use it.</p>	1	125	1	Any	null	ARM	82
7	Grim Trophies	<p>Devourer cultists often adorn their armor with magically enhanced trophies representing their most meaningful kills, such as skulls or other bits of bone or exoskeleton taken from slain foes, defiled holy symbols, broken bits of weapons, or bloodied and tattered badges or seals of authority.<br/> While wearing armor with grim trophies, if you successfully cause a foe to be shaken, the foe applies the –2 penalty from that condition to weapon damage rolls in addition to the other rolls it normally applies to.</p>	1	125	1	Any	null	DS02	53
8	Infrared Sensors	<p>You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>	1	200	1	Any	L	CRB	206
9	Leapers	<p>This system of electric motors and hydraulics augments the strength of your leg muscles, granting you a +8 enhancement bonus to Athletics checks when jumping. As long as you are proficient with the armor it takes no time to activate the leapers, you can choose to activate them or not as part of making a jump check.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light armor.</p>	1	205	1	Light	L	ARM	84
10	Light Projector	<p>This set of powerful lights includes a compact but long-lasting battery. While activated, a light projector increases the light level by one step in a 100-foot cone or a 50-foot radius. You can activate or deactivate the light projector or switch between the two light modes as a move action. </p>	1	150	1	Any	1	ARM	84
11	Pet Carrier	<p>The pet carrier armor upgrade takes one upgrade slot and provides space for one Tiny, two Diminutive, or four Fine creatures to take refuge in your armor. You can open or close a pet carrier as a move action. A creature of appropriate size can enter or exit a pet carrier by using 5 feet of movement to do so. While inside the pet carrier, a creature benefits from total cover and your armor’s environmental protections, but it can’t take any physical actions other than to leave an open carrier.<br/> <em>* The bulk of the pet carrier is 1 when occupied.</em></p>	1	100	1	Any	L	AA2	119
12	Quick-Release Sheath	<p>This articulated compartment can hold a one-handed weapon of no more than light bulk. You can activate this upgrade as a swift action to put the item in your hand as though you’d drawn it.</p>	1	325	1	Any	L	CRB	207
13	Radiation Buffer	<p>This device grants a +2 bonus to your initial saving throw against radiation (see page 403) in addition to any bonuses from your armor’s environmental protection. This doesn’t provide any bonus to saves against the secondary effects of radiation.</p>	1	200	1	Any	L	CRB	207
14	Slickskin	<p>This upgrade gives the armor a particularly slippery coating which is generally a combination of low-friction surfaces, longlasting lubricants, and a redesign of surfaces to remove anything likely to catch on protrusions or be easily grabbed. Your armor grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against grapple combat maneuvers and a +4 bonus to Acrobatics checks when using the escape task.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light armor.</p>	1	300	1	Light	null	ARM	85
15	Snarl Barbs	<p>This upgrade consists of chains and barbs that cover your armor. Frequently used by Kuthite warriors to enhance their fearsome appearance, this upgrade also snarls near misses in close combat. When an opponent attacks you with a melee weapon and misses, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls when attempting to disarm your opponent of the melee weapon used for that attack until the end of your next turn.</p>	1	1500	1	Any	L	PWD	197
16	Stabilizer Springs	<p>These carefully calibrated, high-quality springs installed around the ankles and knees of the armor make your stance more balanced. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to balance on narrow surfaces, a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against trip combat maneuvers, and a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves against effects that knock you prone (such as the grease spell or the knee shot operative exploit).<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor</p>	1	400	1	Light, heavy	L	ARM	85
17	Tensile Reinforcement	<p>When calculating your armor’s hardness and Hit Points (see page 409), treat it as if its item level were 5 higher.</p>	1	150	1	Any	null	CRB	207
18	Thermal Regulator	<p>While activated, a thermal regulator reduces the severity of dangerous temperatures by two steps for its wearer. For example, severe cold becomes comfortable, while extreme cold is reduced to cold. A thermal regulator can be set to protect its wearer from cold or heat, but not both simultaneously. The regulator consumes the attached armor’s environmental protections, but at one-quarter the rate of having protections fully activated.</p>	1	150	1	Any	L	DF02	17
19	Auto-Cpr Unit	<p>This device monitors your blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and temperature. When one or more of these vital signs falls below an acceptable level, the device administers aid, injecting you with stimulants and resuscitating you with a defibrillator as necessary. If you have 0 Hit Points and are dying, at the end of your next turn the auto-CPR unit attempts to stabilize you, attempting a Medicine check to administer first aid to stabilize you with a +5 total skill bonus. If you have a computer interface (see page 82), you can have the computer control activate the auto-CPR unit to attempt first aid when you have the bleed condition, and you add the tier of the computer in the interface to the auto-CPR unit’s total Medicine bonus.</p>	2	850	1	Any	L	ARM	80
20	Automated Loader	<p>This device attaches to powered armor and consists of a small robotic arm and a storage compartment that holds up to 2 bulk of ammunition and batteries. You can activate the automated loader as a move action to reload or recharge a weapon that’s mounted to the powered armor (but not to replace the batteries of the powered armor itself). Abilities that let you reload faster than a move action don’t apply to an automated loader.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in powered armor.</p>	2	750	1	Powered	1	CRB	205
21	Jump Jets	<p>You can activate jump jets as part of a move action in order to fly during your movement. You can fly up to 30 feet (average maneuverability) with a maximum height of 10 feet, or you can fly up to 20 feet straight up. You must land at the end of your move action. Jump jets can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	2	1000	1	Light, heavy	L	CRB	206
22	Omnidirectional Camera	<p>This camera and holographic-display unit covers areas you can’t normally see. Activating the camera is a move action, and while the camera is active, you gain the unflankable universal creature rule.</p>	2	1000	1	Any	L	NSP	153
23	Thrower Arms	<p>This upgrade consists of small motors and other machinery that enhance the motions of your arms from the shoulders to the wrists, allowing you to launch weapons with a greater velocity and precision. You treat the range increments of thrown weapons as 10 feet greater than normal.</p>	2	1000	1	Any	L	ARM	85
24	Force Field, Brown	<p>You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as a standard action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light (including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink.<br/> While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field’s temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field’s color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round.<br/> More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit’s damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade.<br/> <table> <tr><th>COLOR</th><th>CAPACITY</th><th>TEMP HP</th><th>FAST HEALING</th><th>FORTIFICATION</th></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Purple</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>6</td><td>20%</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>7</td><td>40%</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>40</td><td>35</td><td>8</td><td>60%</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>9</td><td>80%</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>100</td><td>50</td><td>10</td><td>100%</td></tr> </table></p>	3	1600	2	Any	L	CRB	206
25	Glamer Projector (Magic)	<p>This upgrade consists of several magical metal rings that project holographic images onto your armor, completely hiding its real appearance. As a standard action, you can change the appearance of your armor to any set of normal clothes or another type of light or heavy armor. This functions as disguise self, but it is only capable of changing the appearance of your armor, not yourself or the rest of your equipment.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	3	1350	1	Light, heavy	null	ARM	83
26	Hydrojet	<p>When you activate this set of impellers as a move action, you gain a swim speed equal to half your land speed. If you already have a swim speed, this upgrade instead grants a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your swim speed.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	3	1400	1	Light, heavy	L	ARM	83
27	Juggernaut Boosters	<p>Your armor greatly increases your momentum when you rush forward. When you move at least 20 feet toward the target before attempting a bull rush combat maneuver, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check, and if the attack hits, you can move the target an additional 5 feet. Your armor also grants you a +4 bonus to Strength checks to break down doors and other barriers if you move at least 10 feet toward the barrier before attempting the check.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>	3	1200	1	Heavy, powered	1	ARM	84
28	Mobility Enhancer, Mk 1	<p>This system of elastic braces and joint support structures reduces the stress heavy armor exerts on your body, allowing you to move faster despite the armor’s bulk. A mobility enhancer reduces the armor’s speed adjustment by an amount determined by the upgrade’s type, as listed below. The speed adjustment of the armor can’t increase above 0 feet.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 3):</strong> Reduce the armor’s speed adjustment by 5 feet.<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 8):</strong> Reduce the armor’s speed adjustment by 10 feet.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in heavy armor.</p>	3	1500	1	Heavy	L	ARM	84
29	Quicksuit (Hybrid)	<p>This device forms a magical link between the different parts of your armor and adjusts the pieces so that you can dive right into or out of the armor. Donning or removing the armor requires only a standard action.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	3	1300	1	Light, heavy	L	ARM	85
30	Reactive Polarization	<p>You can activate this upgrade as a reaction to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to a saving throw against a visual effect that would cause you to become dazzled or blinded. If you fail that save against an effect that would cause you to become blinded, you become dazzled instead.</p>	3	1600	1	Any	L	NSP	153
31	Backup Generator	<p>You can connect charged electric items such as batteries to this miniature generator to recharge them. The electricity comes from the kinetic energy of your movement, which generates 1 charge every 10 minutes of movement. No more than one item can be plugged in at a time, and the generator doesn’t produce charges when you’re resting or otherwise stationary.</p>	4	2100	1	Any	1	CRB	206
32	Climate Control Unit	<p>This upgrade is used primarily on long expeditions into hostile environments. You treat your armor as 3 levels higher for the purposes of determining the duration of its environmental protections and resisting radiation.</p>	4	1950	1	Light, heavy	L	NSP	152
33	Exit Pod	<p>This body harness fits into a suit of powered armor or is built into the frame of heavy armor, allowing you to exit the armor as a move action instead of as a full action. Entering the armor is no faster with an exit pod.<br/> This can be installed only in heavy armor or powered armor.</p>	4	1750	1	Heavy, powered	2	CRB	206
34	Flashblinders, Mk 1	<p>The crystals used at the core of this upgrade are harvested from a slow-moving, geode-like beast that hunts the dark side of Verces and stuns its prey with flashes of light. You can activate this upgrade as a move action to emit a strobe-like burst of radiance. All creatures other than you within 20 feet must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half the upgrade’s item level + your Dexterity modifier) or become blind for 1 round. A set of flashblinders recharges automatically after 1 minute.</p>	4	2000	1	Any	1	PWD	196
35	Hover Field	<p>This system of minor gravity generators creates an invisible but supportive gravitational bubble underneath you, supporting your weight from below by anchoring to a stable surface within an inch or so of your feet, without placing downward pressure on that surface. You hover an inch above the ground, and you don’t leave tracks or trigger any mechanical traps that use a floor-based location trigger. The gravitational bubble needs a strong, stable surface to remain stable—you can move briefly across delicate flooring that won’t support your weight and across water or other liquid surfaces, but you must end your move on a surface that can support you normally or this upgrade ceases to function until you are once more on a stable surface for a full round.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light armor.</p>	4	1800	1	Light	null	ARM	83
36	Longstrider Module	<p>This actuator system mimics the action of leg muscles and tendons when you run, providing assistance and support at the ankles, knees, and hips. This grants you a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your land speed.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light armor</p>	4	2200	1	Light	L	ARM	84
37	Remote-Link Module	<p>This upgrade comes with a control computer module that can be used to pilot a suit of linked powered armor while no creature is wearing it. You can pilot the suit of powered armor that has the upgrade, activating the upgrade as a move action to move the linked armor up to its land speed. You can instead take a full action to activate the linked armor and have it automatically follow the remote at a selected distance from 5 to 500 feet. The linked powered armor can otherwise take no actions or carry any objects or creatures. If the linked armor is ever more than 500 feet from the remote, it immediately stops in place and must be reactivated to be used again.</p>	4	1750	1	Powered	1	NSP	153
38	Targeting Computer	<p>This targeting computer helps you compensate for poor visibility conditions. Ignore concealment on attacks you make. This doesn’t have any effect against targets with total concealment.</p>	4	2250	1	Any	null	CRB	207
39	Agility Enhancer, Mk 2	<p>This upgrade consists of replacing the hard corners of armor with more expensive flexible materials carefully angled and reinforced to increase mobility without sacrificing protective values. Agility enhancers reduce the armor check penalty of your armor, to a minimum of 0. Some agility enhancers apply only to Acrobatics, while others apply to any skill affected by armor check penalties. The amount depends on the agility enhancer type, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 1):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 1 for Acrobatics.<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 5):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 1 for all skills.<br/> <strong>Mk 3 (Level 9):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 2 for Acrobatics.<br/> <strong>Mk 4 (Level 13):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 2 for all skills.<br/> <strong>Mk 5 (Level 17):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 3 for Acrobatics.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	5	3000	1	Light, heavy	L	ARM	80
40	Electrostatic Field, Mk 1	<p>This field over your armor grants you electricity resistance, and any creature that touches you or deals damage to you with a melee weapon takes electricity damage. The resistance granted and damage dealt depend on this upgrade’s type, as noted below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1:</strong> Resistance 5 and 1d6 electricity damage.<br/> <strong>Mk 2:</strong> Resistance 10 and 2d6 electricity damage.<br/> <strong>Mk 3:</strong> Resistance 15 and 3d6 electricity damage.<br/></p>	5	3000	1	Any	null	CRB	206
41	Ghost Armor (Magic)	<p>A ghost armor upgrade consists of ornate silver bands, which create an incorporeal double of your armor and make the armor look gray and insubstantial. The armor grants you a +2 bonus to your EAC against attacks from incorporeal creatures.</p>	5	2900	1	Any	—	ARM	83
42	Jetpack	<p>You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). You can use this for “cruising flight” at a usage of only 1 charge per minute, but you are flat-footed and off-target while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight or vice versa is a standard action. A jetpack can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	5	3100	1	Light, heavy	1	CRB	206
43	Load Lifter	<p>This set of artificial muscles increases the amount of bulk you can carry while wearing your armor by 3.</p>	5	2550	1	Any	null	CRB	207
44	Rampart Plates	<p>These extra-thick armor plates don’t increase your defense in general, but add a little extra protection when you specifically try to defend yourself. When you have the cowering condition or take the total defense or withdraw action, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in heavy armor.</p>	5	2850	1	Heavy	1	ARM	85
45	Telepathic Dampener	<p>You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against mind-affecting effects, but you can’t use or receive telepathic communication.</p>	5	2700	1	Any	L	NSP	153
46	Thermal Capacitor, Mk 1	<p>This upgrade regulates heat, protecting you from extreme temperatures. You can exist comfortably in conditions between –50° and 170° F without needing to attempt Fortitude saves. In addition, the armor grants cold resistance and fire resistance. The amount depends on the capacitor’s type, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1:</strong> Resistance 5<br/> <strong>Mk 2:</strong> Resistance 10<br/> <strong>Mk 3:</strong> Resistance 15</p>	5	3600	1	Any	null	CRB	207
47	Brightlight Projector (Hybrid)	<p>This set of magical illumination functions as a light projector (see page 84), except its magical light can penetrate even magical darkness. While this upgrade is active, your melee attacks gain the bright weapon special property.</p>	6	3000	1	Any	1	ARM	82
48	Endurance Module (Hybrid)	<p>Using advanced technology and powerful restorative magic, this upgrade continuously stimulates your blood circulation, brain, and muscles. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. While you are wearing the armor and this upgrade has a charge, you ignore the effects of the fatigued condition. When an effect would cause you to gain the exhausted condition, as a reaction you can expend the device’s charge to be fatigued instead. The device’s charge replenishes each day</p>	6	4500	1	Any	L	ARM	83
49	Filtered Rebreather	<p>This upgraded rebreather supplements your armor’s ability to provide fresh air and filters out common toxins and poisonous vapors. Armor with this upgrade can provide fresh air for a number of weeks equal to its level. You also gain acid resistance 5 and a +2 bonus to saving throws against poison and disease.</p>	6	4600	1	Any	1	CRB	206
50	Force Field, Purple	<p>You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as a standard action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light (including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink.<br/> While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field’s temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field’s color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round.<br/> More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit’s damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function.

51	Lightwarp Inlay	<p>This specialized coating of glass serpent scales shifts its collective angle in response to localized electrical fields created by a delicate circuitry inlay, allowing the bending of light around you. You can activate this inlay as a standard action to become temporarily invisible (as the invisibility spell, save that the process is purely technological rather than magical). This invisibility lasts until you deactivate it (which you can do as part of any other action) or the inlay runs out of charges. A lightwarp inlay’s charges replenish each day.</p>	6	5000	1	Any	L	AA2	65
52	Phase Shield	<p>You can activate this upgrade to generate a glowing, translucent blue shield on one of your arms that helps you block incoming attacks. Activating or deactivating the shield takes a move action. While the shield is active, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to EAC. The phase shield interferes with your ability to use the arm it’s installed on, so while the phase shield is active, you can hold an item in that hand but not use it or make attacks with it.<br/> This can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>	6	4325	1	Heavy, powered	1	CRB	207
53	Tactical Scaffold	<p>As a full action, you can attach a small armor, longarm, heavy weapon, or sniper weapon to this counterweighted mechanical weapon support. Removing a weapon from it is also a full action. As a move action, you can activate the scaffold, bringing the weapon to your hand or hands. You can activate the scaffold as part of a move action to move, but Quick Draw and other abilities that allow you to draw weapons faster than normal don’t affect the time required to activate it. You can’t wield a weapon mounted to the scaffold without it being activated. When activated, the scaffold tracks your motions and provides support for the weapon attached to it, allowing you to wield two-handed weapons using only one hand. If you wield a heavy weapon with two hands while using the scaffold, treat your Strength score as 2 higher for the purpose of meeting the minimum Strength score for using heavy weapons. If you wield a sniper weapon with two hands while using the scaffold you can use its aimed range increment without taking a move action to aim. If you drop the weapon (or it is successfully disarmed), the scaffold automatically folds away and stows the weapon for later use.</p>	6	4450	2	Heavy	2	ARM	85
54	Absorption Shield (Hybrid)	<p>These electrically charged absorption plates can draw the force of an explosion toward you, dampening the effect for everyone else. When you are within the area of an explosion (such as that of a weapon with the explode special property or an area effect that deals damage and allows a Reflex save for half or no damage), you can activate the absorption shield as a reaction. If the explosion deals damage, you take 1-1/2 times as much damage (150%) and can’t attempt a saving throw against the explosion (or use evasion or improved evasion). Other creatures (and objects, if applicable) within the area take only half damage from the explosion (and can attempt to reduce the damage with a saving throw as normal).<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>	7	6500	1	Heavy, powered	1	ARM	80
55	Adaptive Defense Module, Mk 1	<p>An adaptive defense module emulates the ever-shifting defense of the tekhoinos. When you take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage from an attack, you gain resistance to that energy type equal to 5 × the upgrade’s mark number; this resistance does not apply to the triggering attack, and it lasts for 10 minutes or until you take energy damage of another of those types, triggering a new resistance.</p>	7	6500	1	Any	—	AA2	7
56	Auto-Injector	<p>This armor upgrade has a compartment the size of a small vial. As a full action, you can place a single serum or spell ampule within the compartment. As a move action, you can activate the upgrade to inject the serum into your body, where it affects you as though you had drunk it.</p>	7	7000	1	Any	—	ARM	80
57	Computer Interface	<p>Your armor is wired to allow an integrated onboard computer to monitor your condition and operate some functions of your armor. An armor interface comes with a tier 1 computer with an artificial personality and a single control module linked to your armor. You can access this computer without exposing it or yourself to the environment outside of your armor, and you receive information from it through heads-up displays and broadcasts via your armor’s integrated comm unit.<br/> With a successful Computers check (DC = the DC needed to hack the computer) you can set the computer to give basic information about your condition (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and so on) to authorized users (which you designate), or to anyone with a medkit, advanced medkit, or medical lab. Characters who can access this information gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks they attempt on you.<br/> With 10 minutes of work, you can set the computer’s control module to operate any one system in your armor, as long as that system doesn’t take a full action or longer to activate or deactivate. Common applications are environmental protections or a force field armor upgrade. You can set the computer to operate the upgrade at your command (allowing you to activate one such item each round without taking an action to do so), or set it to automatically trigger the system under specific conditions as follows: the first time you take damage, the first time you take Hit Point damage, when you are stunned, when you are staggered, when you are unconscious, or when the atmospheric conditions change. If the trigger occurs, the computer automatically activates the linked system. This occurs at the end of your next turn after the condition occurs. The control module can be linked to weapons or tools that are part of the armor, subject to the normal limitations of control modules (Core Rulebook 215).<br/> You can install a higher-tier computer into the computer interface, as long as it has light or negligible bulk. You must pay for the additional computer separately, and installing it requires a successful Computers check with a DC equal to the DC to hack the new computer. The computer cannot have countermeasures that require links to the environment beyond the armor (such as a shock grid) or control modules that control anything other than armor systems, and it cannot activate more than one system each round (even if linked to multiple systems with automatic triggers).</p>	7	6000	1	Any	—	ARM	82
58	Deflective Reinforcement	<p>This upgrade gives your armor a uniquely slippery texture. Your armor grants you DR 5/—. In addition, your armor check penalty is reduced by 2 when you attempt an Acrobatics check to escape.</p>	7	7500	1	Any	1	CRB	206
59	Furrofluid Suspension	<p>Your armor dampens vibrations, reducing bludgeoning damage you take by 5 (to a minimum of 0) and reducing your armor check penalty to Stealth checks by 2 (to a minimum of 0). In addition, the DC of Perception checks against you is increased by 5 for creatures using blindsight (vibration) or blindsense (vibration).</p>	7	6500	1	Any	—	AA3	35
60	Glider Foils	<p>As a swift action, you can deploy or undeploy these foils to increase your flight maneuverability from clumsy to average or from average to perfect. Additionally, you can deploy these gliders while falling to slow your descent to 60 feet per round and move horizontally at a rate of 5 feet for every 1 foot you fall. While the glider foils are deployed, your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 0). The glider foils have no power of their own and don’t allow you to gain altitude.</p>	7	6000	2	Light	1	NSP	152
61	Microspur Spray	<p>Eoxian corporations excel at technologies that use unliving materials, and the needle-sized self-replicating bone spurs in this upgrade are no exception. You can activate this upgrade as a standard action to launch microspurs in a 20-foot spread around you. All creatures in this area are affected by harrying fire. A microspur spray’s charges replenish each day.</p>	7	6700	1	Heavy, powered	1	PWD	197
62	Sonic Dampener	<p>This device muffles the incidental sounds you make, and sonic attacks lose power in your vicinity. You gain sonic resistance 5 and reduce your armor check penalty by 1 when making Stealth checks.</p>	7	7150	1	Any	L	CRB	207
63	Explosive Defense Unit	<p>These additional armor plates offer protection against explosions and shrapnel, granting you a +2 enhancement bonus to Reflex saves against weapons with the explode special property. As a full action, you can place a grenade inside a reinforced, eggshaped compartment in the armor upgrade. As a standard action, you can detonate the grenade. This explosion is centered on you, but the upgrade creates a temporary containment field that shields you from the explosion. In all other ways, the grenade functions normally</p>	8	9000	1	Any	L	ARM	83
64	Flashblinders, Mk 2	<p>The crystals used at the core of this upgrade are harvested from a slow-moving, geode-like beast that hunts the dark side of Verces and stuns its prey with flashes of light. You can activate this upgrade as a move action to emit a strobe-like burst of radiance. All creatures other than you within 20 feet must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half the upgrade’s item level + your Dexterity modifier) or become blind for 1 round. A set of flashblinders recharges automatically after 1 minute.</p>	8	10000	1	Any	1	PWD	196
65	Force Field, Black	<p>You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as a standard action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light (including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink.<br/> While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field’s temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field’s color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round.<br/> More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit’s damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade.<br/> <table> <tr><th>COLOR</th><th>CAPACITY</th><th>TEMP HP</th><th>FAST HEALING</th><th>FORTIFICATION</th></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Purple</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>6</td><td>20%</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>7</td><td>40%</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>40</td><td>35</td><td>8</td><td>60%</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>9</td><td>80%</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>100</td><td>50</td><td>10</td><td>100%</td></tr> </table></p>	8	10500	2	Any	L	CRB	206
66	Grandchild’S Cloak	<p>This upgrade is imprinted upon the interior of the armor in the shape of a curled rat. A grandchild’s cloak uses a combination of holographic fields and illusion magic to render you invisible for a short period of time. You can activate a grandchild’s cloak as a move action, and its benefits last until you spend another move action to deactivate it, it runs out of charges, or if you make any kind of attack (as described in the invisibility spell), whichever comes first.<br/> The much rarer greater grandchild’s cloak—which followers of Grandmother Rat stridently insist does not exist—functions as a standard grandchild’s cloak, but it uses only 2 charges per round and its benefits do not end if you attack.<br/> A grandchild’s cloak’s charges replenish each day. This upgrade can be installed only in light armor.</p>	8	10000	1	Light	L	PWD	197
67	Haste Circuit	<p>You can activate the haste circuit as a swift action to gain the benefits of a haste spell until you spend another swift action to deactivate it or it runs out of charges. A haste circuit’s charges replenish each day.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	8	9250	1	Light, heavy	L	CRB	206
68	Mindlink Servos, Mk 1	<p>Mindlink servos allow you to move using purely mental actions. With the base model, you can move only up to a quarter your land speed in a straight line. You can’t move over difficult terrain or simple obstacles, and you can’t take a guarded step. With the more advanced mk 2 mindlink servos, you can move up to half your speed using purely mental actions, changing direction and moving over difficult terrain as normal.</p>	8	9500	2	Light, heavy	2	NSP	153
69	Mobility Enhancer, Mk 2	<p>This system of elastic braces and joint support structures reduces the stress heavy armor exerts on your body, allowing you to move faster despite the armor’s bulk. A mobility enhancer reduces the armor’s speed adjustment by an amount determined by the upgrade’s type, as listed below. The speed adjustment of the armor can’t increase above 0 feet.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 3):</strong> Reduce the armor’s speed adjustment by 5 feet.<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 8):</strong> Reduce the armor’s speed adjustment by 10 feet.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in heavy armor.</p>	8	9500	1	Heavy	L	ARM	84
70	Agility Enhancer, Mk 3	<p>This upgrade consists of replacing the hard corners of armor with more expensive flexible materials carefully angled and reinforced to increase mobility without sacrificing protective values. Agility enhancers reduce the armor check penalty of your armor, to a minimum of 0. Some agility enhancers apply only to Acrobatics, while others apply to any skill affected by armor check penalties. The amount depends on the agility enhancer type, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 1):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 1 for Acrobatics.<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 5):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 1 for all skills.<br/> <strong>Mk 3 (Level 9):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 2 for Acrobatics.<br/> <strong>Mk 4 (Level 13):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 2 for all skills.<br/> <strong>Mk 5 (Level 17):</strong> Reduce the penalty by 3 for Acrobatics.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	9	13000	1	Light, heavy	L	ARM	80
71	Battery Unit	<p>This upgrade, usually installed on the chest or back of the armor, has a compartment capable of storing any one battery. Power cables run from the battery slot to the palms of your hands. As a full action, you can install a battery in the compartment or remove a battery from it. When you attack with a powered weapon or use a technological item you are holding in your hand, you can expend charges from the battery stored in the upgrade rather than the weapon or item’s own battery, provided that the item is capable of using a battery of that capacity.</p>	9	12000	1	Any	L	ARM	82
72	Electrostatic Field, Mk 2	<p>This field over your armor grants you electricity resistance, and any creature that touches you or deals damage to you with a melee weapon takes electricity damage. The resistance granted and damage dealt depend on this upgrade’s type, as noted below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1:</strong> Resistance 5 and 1d6 electricity damage.<br/> <strong>Mk 2:</strong> Resistance 10 and 2d6 electricity damage.<br/> <strong>Mk 3:</strong> Resistance 15 and 3d6 electricity damage.<br/></p>	9	13000	1	Any	null	CRB	206
73	Forcepack	<p>A forcepack grants you a fly speed of 60 feet (average maneuverability). You can use this for “cruising flight” at a usage of 1 charge per minute, but you are flat-footed and off-target while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight, or back, is a standard action. A forcepack can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.</p>	9	13100	1	Light, heavy	1	CRB	206
74	Haze Field	<p>Haze fields were developed on Akiton to mimic the thick haze that forms from the dust of the dry seabeds of that world. You can activate a haze field as a move action, and its benefits last until you spend another move action to deactivate it or it runs out of charges. While active, the field creates a visual haze centered on you. This has no impact on visibility at short range, but you take a –2 penalty to all attack rolls and Perception checks against targets 30 or more feet away, and creatures 30 or more feet away take the same penalties to attacks and Perception checks against you. A haze field’s charges replenish each day.</p>	9	13000	1	Any	null	PWD	197
75	Medical Interface, Mk 1 (Hybrid)	<p>This medical upgrade stimulates your metabolism and natural healing capabilities with nanites. When you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points, you also recover some Hit Points. The amount of healing depends on the type of the medical interface, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 9):</strong> 5 Hit Points<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 15):</strong> 10 Hit Points<br/> <strong>Mk 3 (Level 19):</strong> 15 Hit Points</p>	9	14000	1	Any	L	ARM	84
76	Reaction Accelerator (Hybrid)	<p>This upgrade magically analyzes stress hormones in your bloodstream and, when you are in a threatening situation, stimulates your glands to release hormones that allow you to react quickly. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. When you roll initiative, after seeing the result of your initiative check, you can immediately spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll your initiative with an additional +4 bonus and take the better of your original result or your new result.</p>	9	13500	1	Any	L	ARM	85
77	Adaptive Energy Shield	<p>This intelligent polymer weave covers the entire armor. When in an unattuned state, the first time you take energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the adaptive mesh transforms to better withstand attacks of the same type; your armor thereafter grants you energy resistance 5 against that energy type. The energy resistance does not apply to the initial attack. The armor remains attuned to that energy type (even if you take other forms of energy damage) until it has taken no damage of the attuned type for 5 minutes. It then becomes unattuned.</p>	10	17500	1	Any	L	ARM	80
78	Courage Module (Hybrid)	<p>Using fear-suppressing chemicals and magic, this upgrade bolsters your Resolve. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. While you are wearing the armor and this upgrade has a charge, you ignore the effects of the shaken condition. When an effect would cause you to gain the frightened or panicked condition, as a reaction you can expend the device’s charge to be shaken for the same amount of time instead. The device’s charge replenishes each day.</p>	10	18300	1	Any	L	ARM	82
79	Echolocation Detection Unit	<p>This package of delicate sensors and transmitters provides a heads-up display of the location of nearby sounds, granting you blindsense (sound) with a range of 30 feet.</p>	10	19000	1	Any	—	AA3	57
80	Force Field, White	<p>You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as a standard action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light (including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink.<br/> While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first.

83	Attractor Field (Hybrid)	<p>This module employs a combination of magnetic fields and magical energies that cause melee weapons that strike you to get stuck. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24-hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for a 24-hour cool-down period. When an enemy hits you with a melee weapon, as a reaction you can activate this upgrade, which grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to disarm combat maneuvers to disarm the enemy of that weapon before the beginning of the enemy’s next turn. An attractor field’s charges replenish each day.</p>	11	24000	1	Any	L	ARM	80
84	Bodyguard Module (Magic)	<p>This shield-shaped armor plate pulses with magical energy when another upgrade of the same type is nearby. When an ally within 30 feet who is also wearing a bodyguard module takes damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to cause the target to take only half the damage, and you take the amount of damage not taken by the target. The damage you take can’t be negated, reduced, or redirected in any way. Forms of harm that do not involve Hit Points or Stamina Points, such as ability drain, charm effects, death effects, permanent negative levels, and temporary ability damage, are not affected.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>	11	24400	1	Heavy, powered	L	ARM	82
85	Magic Resistor, Mk 1 (Magic)	<p>These platinum armor plates have protective arcane sigils etched into them. They must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before they function, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. The upgrade draws on your own life force and experience to grant you spell resistance. The amount depends on your level, key ability score, and the upgrade’s type, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 11):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +4) + your character level<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 14):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +5) + your character level + 1<br/> <strong>Mk 3 (Level 17):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +6) + your character level + 2<br/> <strong>Mk 4 (Level 20):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +7) + your character level + 3<br/> The mk 3 and mk 4 models can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>	11	23500	1	Any	1	ARM	84

89	Lingual Scrambler (Hybrid)	<p>This system of miniature microphones, speakers, and advanced circuitry covers your ears. You can activate or deactivate the scrambler as a move action. While activated, you can hear most sounds normally, but the device scrambles all speech into incomprehensible nonsense, and you are treated as though you didn’t understand any languages. This makes you immune to all language-dependent abilities, regardless of whether they are being used by allies or enemies. Telepathic abilities and other forms of communication that don’t rely on intelligible speech affect you normally. For example, an envoy using the universal expression envoy improvisation can affect you with envoy improvisations that are normally language-dependent. </p>	12	32800	1	Any	—	ARM	84
90	Neutronium Shell (Hybrid)	<p>A suit of heavy or powered armor can be sprayed with a thin coat of magically stabilized neutronium. It takes an hour to apply a neutronium shell, and 8 hours of work to remove one.

It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. While you are wearing the armor and this upgrade has a charge, you ignore the effects of the staggered condition. When an effect would cause you to gain the dazed, paralyzed, or stunned condition, as a reaction you can expend the device’s charge to be staggered for the same amount of time instead. The device’s charge replenishes each day. </p>	13	50000	1	Any	L	ARM	83
95	Spell Reflector, Mk 1	<p>You can activate a spell reflector as a reaction when you’re targeted by a spell. This does not affect spells that include an area you are in or affect you in other ways; it affects only those that target you specifically. The spell is reflected on its caster, as if the caster had been the target. The type of spell reflector determines the highest level of spell it can reflect. A spell reflector’s charge replenishes each day.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.<br/> <strong>Mk 1:</strong> You can reflect a spell of 4th level or lower.<br/> <strong>Mk 2:</strong> You can reflect a spell of 6th level or lower.</p>	13	47950	1	Light, heavy	1	CRB	207
96	Teleportation Unit (Hybrid)	<p>This upgrade combines an advanced, real-time locating system with a magical teleportation device. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. As a standard action, you can teleport (per dimension door), vanishing and reappearing in a burst of what looks like holographic pixels. A teleportation unit’s charges replenish each day</p>	13	52000	1	Any	1	ARM	85
97	Adaptive Defense Module, Mk 2	<p>An adaptive defense module emulates the ever-shifting defense of the tekhoinos. When you take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage from an attack, you gain resistance to that energy type equal to 5 × the upgrade’s mark number; this resistance does not apply to the triggering attack, and it lasts for 10 minutes or until you take energy damage of another of those types, triggering a new resistance.</p>	14	75000	1	Any	—	AA2	7
98	Force Field, Green	<p>You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as a standard action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light (including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink.<br/> While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field’s temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field’s color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round.<br/> More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit’s damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade.<br/> <table> <tr><th>COLOR</th><th>CAPACITY</th><th>TEMP HP</th><th>FAST HEALING</th><th>FORTIFICATION</th></tr> <tr><td>Brown</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Purple</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Black</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Gray</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>0%</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>6</td><td>20%</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>7</td><td>40%</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>40</td><td>35</td><td>8</td><td>60%</td></tr> <tr><td>Orange</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>9</td><td>80%</td></tr> <tr><td>Prismatic</td><td>100</td><td>50</td><td>10</td><td>100%</td></tr> </table></p>	14	80000	2	Any	L	CRB	206
99	Fortified Plates, Mk 1	<p>This upgrade reinforces critical areas of your armor with extra defensive plates, granting you a fortification ability, which functions as a force field’s fortification (Core Rulebook 206) except the ability is always active. The fortification granted by fortified plates doesn’t stack with a force field’s fortification or other similar abilities. The percentage depends on the upgrade’s type, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 14):</strong> 20% chance<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 15):</strong> 40% chance<br/> <strong>Mk 3 (Level 16):</strong> 60% chance<br/> <strong>Mk 4 (Level 17):</strong> 80% chance<br/> <strong>Mk 5 (Level 19):</strong> 100% chance<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>	14	65500	1	Heavy, powered	2	ARM	83

It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. As a move action, you can gain protection against certain necromantic attacks, per death ward, until you spend another move action to deactivate the upgrade or it runs out of charges. A life shield’s charges replenish each day.</p>	14	64000	1	Any	L	ARM	84
101	Magic Resistor, Mk 2 (Magic)	<p>These platinum armor plates have protective arcane sigils etched into them. They must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before they function, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. The upgrade draws on your own life force and experience to grant you spell resistance. The amount depends on your level, key ability score, and the upgrade’s type, as listed below.<br/> <strong>Mk 1 (Level 11):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +4) + your character level<br/> <strong>Mk 2 (Level 14):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +5) + your character level + 1<br/> <strong>Mk 3 (Level 17):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +6) + your character level + 2<br/> <strong>Mk 4 (Level 20):</strong> Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +7) + your character level + 3<br/> The mk 3 and mk 4 models can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>	14	70000	2	Any	2	ARM	84
102	Mindlink Servos, Mk 2	<p>Mindlink servos allow you to move using purely mental actions. With the base model, you can move only up to a quarter your land speed in a straight line. You can’t move over difficult terrain or simple obstacles, and you can’t take a guarded step. With the more advanced mk 2 mindlink servos, you can move up to half your speed using purely mental actions, changing direction and moving over difficult terrain as normal.</p>	14	71000	2	Light, heavy	2	NSP	153
103	Titan Shield	<p>This emitter generates a wide, unidirectional energy shield that protects against incoming attacks. You can activate or deactivate the shield as a move action. When you activate it, choose one edge of your space. The shield extends along three continuous edges in a straight line centered on the chosen edge. The shield provides cover against attacks coming from the far side of the shield but not against attacks originating from the side you’re on.<br/> If you move, you can reposition your shield, moving it to a different edge of your space. You can also spend a move action to reposition the shield without leaving your space.<br/> This upgrade can be installed only in powered armor.</p>	14	75000	1	Powered	2	CRB	207
104	Displacement Field (Hybrid)	<p>This optical device bends light around you. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. You can activate the displacement field as a move action to gain the benefits of a displacement spell until you spend another move action to deactivate it or it runs out of charges. A displacement field’s charges replenish each day.</p>	15	120000	2	Any	1	ARM	82
105	Fortified Plates, Mk 2	<p>This upgrade reinforces critical areas of your armor with extra defensive plates, granting you a fortification ability, which functions as a force field’s fortification (Core Rulebook 206) except the ability is always active.

106	Grandchild’S Cloak, Greater	<p>This upgrade is imprinted upon the interior of the armor in the shape of a curled rat. A grandchild’s cloak uses a combination of holographic fields and illusion magic to render you invisible for a short period of time. You can activate a grandchild’s cloak as a move action, and its benefits last until you spend another move action to deactivate it, it runs out of charges, or if you make any kind of attack (as described in the invisibility spell), whichever comes first.<br/> The much rarer greater grandchild’s cloak—which followers of Grandmother Rat stridently insist does not exist—functions as a standard grandchild’s cloak, but it uses only 2 charges per round and its benefits do not end if you attack.<br/> A grandchild’s cloak’s charges replenish each day. This upgrade can be installed only in light armor.</p>	15	120000	1	Light	L	PWD	197
107	Medical Interface, Mk 2 (Hybrid)	<p>This medical upgrade stimulates your metabolism and natural healing capabilities with nanites.

109	Emergency Defense Sphere	<p>An emergency defense sphere system monitors your vital signs and automatically triggers a resilient sphere centered on you if you suffer from the dying, helpless, paralyzed, or stunned conditions. The sphere functions as the spell, except its diameter extends only to the space you occupy, and the sphere remains until the unit runs out of charges. If dispelled while there are charges remaining, the sphere reactivates at the beginning of your next turn if you still have any of the triggering conditions. The upgrade must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours.</p>	16	162000	1	Any	L	NSP	152
110	Flashblinders, Mk 4	<p>The crystals used at the core of this upgrade are harvested from a slow-moving, geode-like beast that hunts the dark side of Verces and stuns its prey with flashes of light. You can activate this upgrade as a move action to emit a strobe-like burst of radiance. All creatures other than you within 20 feet must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half the upgrade’s item level + your Dexterity modifier) or become blind for 1 round. A set of flashblinders recharges automatically after 1 minute.</p>	16	180000	1	Any	1	PWD	197
