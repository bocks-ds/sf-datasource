1	Adaptive Biochains	Biotech	<p>You can duplicate the effects of cybernetics with biotech by using adaptive biochains—microscopic cells that can reform themselves into replacements for technology within the body of a living host. This replicates the effects of any cybernetic augmentation, but it costs an additional 10% due to the price of the biochains. Adaptive biochains can also be used to replace any existing cybernetic with a biotech version of the same device; doing so has the same price and time as introducing a new adaptive biochain.</p>	3	Varies	Varies	CRB	211
2	Adaptive Fingerprints	Cybernetics	<p>Originally created for military operatives but favored by criminals throughout the galaxy, these pads of nanotechinfused artificial flesh replace the skin of your palms and fingertips. You leave no identifying fingerprints behind when touching an object or surface, and you can’t be identified through your fingerprints. In addition, if you have access to records of another individual’s fingerprints, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create wrinkled patterns in the pads that mimic those fingerprints for 1 hour, allowing you to bypass security features or leave false evidence.</p>	6	4030	All Hands	SS2	44
3	Adrenal Booster	Cybernetics	<p>This pair of nanocarbon devices replaces part of your adrenal glands, and microscopic threads delicately link them to your endocrine system. When you are dying, the number of Resolve Points you need to stabilize is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1 Resolve Point needed to stabilize). This ability doesn’t stack with any other ability that allows you to spend fewer Resolve Points to stabilize. In addition, once per day, you can spend the required Resolve Points to stabilize and 1 additional Resolve Point to stay in the fight (regaining 1 Hit Point) in the same round.</p>	8	8900	Endocrine	SS2	44
4	Aeon eye	Magitech	<p>An aeon eye replaces one of your eyes with a specialized aeon stone connected to your ocular nerves. As a move action, you can mentally activate or deactivate this augmentation, which grants you sense through (vision) with a range of 60 feet. While the augmentation is active, you gain no benefit from other special visual senses, and you can’t see anything beyond the augmentation’s range.</p>	13	46000	Eye	AT02	44
5	Aeon gage	Magitech	<p>An aeon gage not only functions as a polyhand (Core Rulebook 210), but it also has six sockets in which aeon stones can be slotted. You gain the benefit of each aeon stone slotted in your aeon gage as if the stone orbited you. If all six sockets contain aeon stones, you can also cast one or more of the spells listed below as spell-like abilities. Total the item levels of the aeon stones slotted into the aeon gage to determine the spells you have access to. While you have access to a spell, you also have access to any spell from a lower level range, as follows: 6–30, caustic conversion; 31-60, arcing surge; 61–90, corrosive haze; 91–120, heat leech. The aeon gage has a number of charges per day equal to twice the highest level of spell it provides as a spell-like ability. Using a spell-like ability from the gage consumes a number of charges equal to that spell’s level. The caster level for these spells is 16th.</p>	16	200000	Hand	AT02	44

36	Cardiac Accelerator	Cybernetics	<p>This implant plugs directly into your heart and can be triggered to overclock the performance of your heart and circulatory system. When you run, charge, or take a move action to move, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to increase your speed (in the relevant mode of movement) by 20 feet for that action. This extra movement is treated as an enhancement bonus.<br/> Alternatively, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you attempt a Reflex saving throw to gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your roll.</p>	6	3850	Heart	CRB	208
37	Cerebral Countermeasures	Biotech	<p>A cerebral countermeasure is a tiny gland that constantly monitors your brainwaves, watching for unexpected spikes in activity that indicate mental assault. As a reaction before you attempt a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you can cause the gland to release proteins that deflect and confuse mental attacks by overloading the chemical receptors that would otherwise respond to the mental attack. This grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to your Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects until the end of your next turn. The disruption this defense causes makes it difficult to concentrate, giving you a –2 penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks until the end of your next turn.</p>	6	4200	Brain	AA2	19
38	Charged skin	Magitech	<p>Your skin slowly generates electricity that can be used to power devices that require power measured in charges from a battery to function, such as a powered weapon. You must be touching the item to use it. Your charged skin holds 10 such charges, which are replenished each day after a full night’s rest. You can’t charge a battery or item with your charged skin; you can spend charges directly from it only to power held devices.</p>	5	3075	Skin	ARM	90
39	Cleansing Breath	Biotech	<p>Organic sacs implanted within your lungs cause you to exhale airborne antibodies and antitoxins. You and creatures breathing the same air within 30 feet of you can roll twice on saving throws against diseases and poisons and take the higher result.</p>	18	342000	Lungs	ARM	86
40	Climbing Suckers	Biotech	<p>The soles of your feet become covered in fleshy slats you can open and close, providing you a climb speed of 20 feet (see page 259). You don’t need to attempt Athletics checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). You don’t benefit from climbing suckers unless you’re barefoot or wearing custom clothing, and you can not be wearing more than light armor. Climbing suckers integrate into your natural feet and do not require you to replace your feet and legs. Climbing suckers can be installed into the feet of prosthetic legs.</p>	3	1200	All Feet	CRB	211
41	Clinging Hands	Biotech	<p>Your hands are covered with tiny fibers like those on a gecko’s toes. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your KAC against disarm combat maneuvers and to attacks to perform disarm and grapple combat maneuvers. You can ignore any increase to the DCs of Athletics checks to climb due to slipperiness, iciness, or heavy gravity. You can’t benefit from clinging hands if you are wearing armor or gloves that have not been either tailored or adjusted for you (Core Rulebook 196).</p>	3	1350	All Hands	ARM	86
42	Cloaking skin, greater	Magitech	<p>Many of your pores are replaced with magically regulated and directed holographic projectors that work together to automatically match your surrounding environment, rendering you invisible per invisibility. Once per day, you can enable your cloaking skin as a standard action, turning you invisible for 10 minutes. A greater cloaking skin functions as greater invisibility, but the effect lasts for only 10 rounds. You can disable either model of cloaking skin as a move action.</p>	17	270000	Skin	ARM	90

44	Control mirror neurons	Magitech	<p>Neurons in your brain that would normally help you imagine what another person is experiencing are amplified magically, allowing you to decide what another creature does. As a full action, you can target any creature of your type that you are observing and attempt to control that individual. This functions as dominate person (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) for as long as you continue to observe the target, except establishing the effect doesn’t require an attack roll, and no command you give the target can take more than a standard action to complete. Issuing a command is a move action. You can’t target a creature again for 24 hours after it succeeds at its saving throw against this effect or the duration ends. Once you use your control mirror neurons, you can’t use them again until you’ve rested to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge them immediately.</p>	18	365000	Brain	ARM	90
45	Corpseskin, Mk 1	Necrograft	<p>Perhaps as much a fashion statement as an augmentation, corpseskin replaces living skin with mummified flesh. Corpseskin insulates against cold, though it lacks the sensitivity of living flesh. You gain an amount of cold resistance equal to the necrograft’s mark. If you have cold resistance from your racial traits that is equal to or greater than that from your corpseskin (and doesn’t explicitly stack with other sources of energy resistance), adding corpseskin increases the value of that cold resistance by 1. If you have cold resistance from your racial traits of a value less than that of your corpseskin, the value of the cold resistance from your corpseskin increases by 1.<br/> Regardless of your corpseskin’s model, you take a –2 penalty to Perception checks based primarily on touch and gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against pain effects. The necrograft grants a +5 competence bonus to Disguise checks to impersonate corporeal, non-skeletal undead, but it increases the DC of disguising yourself as a living creature by 5 (in addition to any other modifiers).

The new organ is controlled by a wirelessly paired processor installed in your heart. When you have a standard detoxifier installed, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Fortitude saves against diseases, drugs, poisons, and radiation, and you are immune to addiction. Once per day when affected by a poison, you can roll your Fortitude save twice and take the better result. The enhanced detoxifier grants all of the above bonuses, as well as the ability to roll saving throws against poison twice per day. In addition, you automatically stabilize if reduced to 0 Hit Points as a result of damage from a poison. The elite detoxifier grants immunity to poison, as well as the bonuses to other Fortitude saves from the standard model.</p>	5	3500	Heart	SS2	45
73	Dimensional braces	Magitech	<p>Your legs are fitted with braces attuned to the resonance frequency of the Astral Plane.

74	Dispelling hand	Magitech	<p>Holographic mystic sigils project from your hand when you activate this implant. Your hand must be free to do so. As a reaction, you can gain a +1 insight bonus to your AC against a spell that requires a successful attack roll. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can use dispel magic as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your level, but it can’t counter spells and it can’t target anything other than you unless you touch the target. To affect an unwilling target, you must hit it with a melee attack against its EAC; you activate the augmentation as part of the attack roll, and you can add your key ability score modifier to this attack roll instead of your Strength modifier if it is higher. Once you use dispel magic this way, you can’t use your dispelling hand for either of its uses until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge it immediately.</p>	9	14300	Hand	ARM	90
75	Disquieting Nanities	Cybernetics	<p><p>This augmentation infuses your skin with a host of iridescent nanites that swirl in hypnotic patterns. Internally, some of the nanites cluster around your voice box, slightly modifying your voice to create a kind of rhythmic reverberation. As a standard action, you can activate the nanites. After the first round, you must use a swift action each round to maintain the effect. A creature that can see or hear you when the nanites are activated must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or be shaken for as long it can see or hear you and you continue the effect. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it is immune to the effect of the nanites for 24 hours. You can choose for the nanites to not affect allies. If the creature can both see and hear you, it takes a –2 penalty to the saving throw. This is a mind-affecting, sense-dependent effect. You can use the augmentation for 8 rounds per day, though these rounds need not be consecutive.</p></p>	8	10000	Skin and Throat	DS05	9

121	Gravitational harness, mk 1	Magitech	<p>Slim neutronium-core gravitational crystals attached to your spine using intense alchemical processes allow you to manipulate gravity once per day.<br/> With a mk 1 gravitational harness, you can increase or lower gravity for yourself and everything you carry by one step for 2 rounds. This applies the usual effects of lower gravity, including falling more slowly and increased carrying capacity. You can activate, change, or end the effect as a standard action or reaction. If you use a reaction, you can’t take a standard action on your next turn. You can’t make gravity stronger than high gravity or weaker than light gravity. In zero gravity, activating the augmentation instead grants you a supernatural fly speed of 15 feet with perfect maneuverability. You can’t use the fly speed to run or while overburdened.<br/> A mk 2 gravitational harness functions as the mk 1 model, except as follows. The effect lasts for a total of 10 rounds, though you need not use them consecutively. The augmentation can increase or decrease your gravity by up to two steps or negate gravity for you in an area of standard or light gravity. While you have the augmentation active in zero gravity or while negating gravity for yourself, your fly speed is 30 feet.<br/> A mk 3 gravitation harness functions as the mk 2 model, except as follows. The effect lasts for a total of 10 minutes. You need not use the minutes consecutively, but you must use them in 1-minute increments.

124	Heart of darkness	Magitech	<p>The piercing hooks of a heart of darkness augmentation hold the flesh, muscle, and ribs of your chest open, revealing a gory window to your heart. Dark fibers of the augmentation weave wisps around and drive deep into that organ, tapping its vital energies. Each day, after you finish a rest during which you could regain Resolve Points and daily abilities, you gain the benefits of death ward. The spell has a duration of 10 minutes, but this duration starts to elapse only after the first time you use a benefit of the spell during the day. You can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to stop the duration from elapsing, suspending the remaining duration until you use a benefit of the spell again and resume the duration.<br/> In addition, you can activate the heart of darkness to cast mass inflict pain (caster level 16th, save DC = 16 + your key ability score modifier) centered on yourself. You select targets in the area, but unless you spend 1 Resolve Point, you are also subjected to the spell. In addition, if the light in the area is brighter than dim, it drops to dim and remains so until the mass inflict pain spell you cast no longer affects anyone. Nonmagical light can’t raise the light level of this dim light.<br/> Once you use mass inflict pain in this way, you can't do so again until you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points. However, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge the augmentation immediately.</p>	16	145000	Heart	SS2	52
125	Hideaway limb, Quickdraw	Cybernetics	<p>This compartment is hidden inside one of your limbs. You can conceal items inside and protect them with a simple passcode. The compartment can hold items of negligible bulk and items of light bulk that are either relatively small or can be folded or contracted to fit. A hideaway in a leg (in a human) can hold more than one in an arm, and the creature’s size also adjusts the capacity. The GM decides what can fit.<br/>When the compartment is closed, the seam in your flesh is difficult to detect. You gain a +2 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to conceal items in a hideaway limb. Though this compartment can usually foil a simple pat down, most security checkpoints include a scan that can detect such devices. Retrieving an item from a hideaway limb is a move action instead of a standard action. This type of augmentation is for Small and Medium creatures only. Hideaway limbs for creatures larger than Medium typically cost more but can hold items of greater size or bulk.<br/>If you have a quickdraw hideaway limb, the compartment is integrated with a specific weapon. This allows you to draw the weapon as a swift action or as part of making an attack or full attack (similar to using the Quick Draw feat). A quickdraw hideaway limb works only if the limb is one you can normally aim and attack with, typically an arm. You can’t, for example, put a quickdraw hideaway limb in your leg and have the weapon spring into your hand.<br/>You can have a mount installed in a quickdraw limb that holds the weapon in place while you shoot. You still can’t use your hand for other purposes, but you gain a +2 bonus to KAC against disarm attempts. The mount can’t hold a weapon that requires more than one hand to operate. You can’t hide other objects inside a quickdraw hideaway limb—there’s room for only the weapon.<br/>Nothing stored in a hideaway limb is considered part of the cybernetic, and the stored item does not gain the cybernetic’s immunity to attacks affecting technological devices.</p>	5	3050	Arm or Leg	CRB	210

You must concentrate on the illusion as a move action to maintain it, and you must keep your eyes on the illusion to concentrate, treating all other creatures as if they had concealment. Casting a spell (including creating a new illusion with your holographic eyes) immediately ends your concentration. The effect’s caster level is equal to your level, and the Will save DC to disbelieve it is equal to 10 + half your level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>	20	820000	Brain and eyes	ARM	92

155	Morphic skin, advanced	Magitech	<p>Your skin is linked to implanted magical glands that release mutagenic enzymes and transmutation magic. Using morphic skin requires you to concentrate on the desired features during a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points; this is an exception to the normal rule that you can’t perform any tasks while taking a 10-minute rest to recover your Stamina Points. The change completes at the end of the rest.<br/> Basic morphic skin allows you to alter your appearance and voice within the normal bounds for your species, age, weight, and sex. You can adjust your height by up to 3 inches, become broader or thinner, become lighter or darker, alter apparent musculature (although your ability scores do not change), and adjust the shape of your features and the color of your hair, scales, or similar minor features. You ignore any penalties to Disguise checks for altering these major features, but you lack enough control to precisely match a specific individual.<br/> Advanced morphic skin offers the same options as the basic model, as well as the ability to change your apparent sex and age, alter your height by up to 1 foot, and gain features of another species of the same creature type (although you don’t gain or lose abilities as a result).<br/> Doppelganger morphic skin offers the same options as the advanced model, as well as the ability to assume a specific individual’s appearance within the augmentation’s limits. When mimicking an individual this way, you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to your Disguise check to alter your form and to skill checks to bypass biometric security keyed to that individual.</p>	4	2030	Skin	ARM	92

While so affected, you see and hear what your undead minion perceives, but you cannot hear, see, smell, or taste what your own body experiences, though your senses of touch and pain remain. You can return your senses to your own body with a swift action. In addition, you can command undead under your control telepathically, including mindless undead. You must have line of sight or be using the undead creature’s senses to exert control in this manner. Using your necrograft to transfer your senses counts as a scrying effect.<br/> Necrocortexes are compatible with undead brains and are often implanted in bone sages and other powerful Eoxians— the better to command disposable minions from a distance. The range of a mk 1 necrocortex is 1,000 feet. The range of a mk 2 necrocortex is 10 miles. The range of a mk 3 necrocortex is 1,000 miles; additionally, you can bind your necrocortex to a single, willing undead creature (which requires 1 hour of concentration), allowing you to transfer your senses to that creature as if it were under your control.

175	Photoenergetic Node	Biotech	<p>Implanting a tashtari’s photoenergetic node into your hand causes the appendage to glow with faint light. As a move action, you can discharge energy stored in your photoenergetic node into an analog melee weapon that you are currently holding in the same hand that has this biotech augmentation installed. The released energy instantaneously superheats the melee weapon, causing the weapon to deal 1d6 additional fire damage on a successful attack. The affected weapon deals this additional damage for 1 round for every 2 character levels you have. While heated, the affected weapon also sheds light as a flashlight, lantern, or beacon (you choose when you activate the augmentation). Once you’ve expended your photoenergetic node, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it immediately.</p>	2	625	Hand	AA2	125
176	Polarizing palm	Cybernetics	<p>One of your hands contains a microscopic matrix of electromagnetically charged wires and nodes that is kept powered by your own nervous system. As long as you aren’t holding or wielding an item in that hand, you can use it as a standard action to make a melee attack roll against a target’s EAC. If you hit, a technological item that target is holding or wearing in a visible, accessible manner (such as on a belt) or a weapon that is powered by a battery that target is wielding loses 1d6+1 charges. This amount is doubled if you score a critical hit.</p>	7	5850	Hand	SS2	45
177	Polyhand	Cybernetics	<p>You replace your entire hand with a hand made of reprogrammable microscopic adamantine prisms. With either a mental command or a programmable interface built into the hand, you can reconfigure your hand into the shape of various tools. The hand can contain programming for nine different tools, in addition to a configuration for a normal hand for your species. As a move action, you can switch the setting, causing the adamantine pieces to realign into the shape of the chosen tool. The tool has all the flexibility of the normal tool (or of a hand, if set to that).<br/>Programming a new tool into the polyhand takes 10 minutes, and you must choose either to fill an empty slot or to replace a programmed tool. The tool replicated must be 8th level or lower. The polyhand can replicate the moving parts of a tool, but you must supply any fuel or batteries needed for the tool to function. The tool cannot produce substances, and since it’s not very conductive (important so as to avoid shocking the user), it can’t serve as a power conduit or data transmission line. The GM has final say in deciding which tools you can duplicate. The tools within engineering kits and similar kits can be duplicated, subject to the restrictions above.<br/>You can’t replace the hand setting based on your biology, which is required for the polyhand to function properly. You can add a hand corresponding to another species in any slot that isn’t reserved; for instance, a human could program her polyhand to replicate a shirren hand. This can’t duplicate features of a unique individual, such as thumbprints. You can install a polyhand into a prosthetic limb that replaces an arm as if the prosthetic were a natural arm.<br/>The adamantine construction makes the polyhand extremely durable (see page 408 in Chapter 11 for more information about adamantine). This doesn’t change the amount of unarmed strike damage, no matter the form your polyhand is in. The polyhand can’t maintain structural integrity if extended too far, so it can’t assume a form more than one and a half feet long in any dimension. Consequently, it can’t extend your reach.</p>	14	71000	Hand	CRB	210

However, you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge the augmentation immediately.</p>	6	4400	Throat	AT02	45
207	Respiration Compounder	Cybernetics	<p>A respiration compounder consists of a series of modules that attach to your lungs, letting you survive longer without having to breathe. Treat your Constitution score as though it were doubled for the purpose of how long you can hold your breath. You also gain a +4 bonus to Constitution checks to continue holding your breath. This doesn’t protect you from other dangers of an airless environment.<br/>The compounder also filters your air, granting a +2 bonus to saving throws against inhaled poisons or other airborne toxins.</p>	1	250	Lungs	CRB	210
208	Restless pineal gland	Magitech	<p>The melatonin produced by a restless pineal gland is supercharged with mystic energy. You need only 2 hours of sleep each day and this allows you to regain daily-use abilities and slots, but you can’t regain your daily abilities spell slots more than once per day. In addition, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against spells and other effects that would put you to sleep. Once per day, you can wake yourself from sleeping as a full action.</p>	7	5500	Endocrine	ARM	93
209	Restraining spinneret	Biotech	<p>Your hand conceals a rapid-acting spinneret you can use to entangle an opponent with sticky webbing if you succeed at a melee attack against their EAC. You can add your Dexterity modifier to this attack roll rather than your Strength modifier. If you hit, your target gains the entangled condition for 1d4 rounds. Ending the entangled condition requires the target to succeed at an Acrobatics check or Strength check as a move action (DC = 10 + half your level + your Dexterity modifier). Once you have used your restraining spinneret, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.</p>	1	330	Hand	ARM	87

211	Sciatic agonizer	Magitech	<p>A sciatic agonizer consists of long needles driven precisely through the flesh and bone of your hips and sacral spine, connected to a series of barbell piercings running down the back of your legs with fibers running deep into the leg and through its nerves. With a twist, you can activate these piercings, blasting your nervous system with pain and shocking your legs into motion.<br/> Each time you activate the sciatic agonizer, you take damage equal to your level. This damage can’t be reduced or redirected in any way. You can activate the augmentation as a swift action to gain one of the following benefits.</p>	14	75000	All legs	SS2	52
212	Selective ears	Magitech	<p>Your ears are implanted with magical sound-dampening membranes. You can activate selective ears as a move action or as a reaction to protect yourself from dangerous sounds. When you activate your selective ears as a reaction, you can’t take a move action on your next turn. Selective ears have three modes: inactive, muffling, and silence. Your selective ears remain in their current mode until you change them. While your selective ears are in muffling mode, you take a –2 penalty to initiative checks and hearing-based Perception checks, but you can’t be deafened for more than 1 round by sonic effects and you have sonic resistance 1. While your selective ears are in silence mode, you are deafened and thus immune to sound-based sensedependent effects, and you also have sonic resistance 5.</p>	5	2830	Ears	ARM	93

222	Shortwave Receiver-transmitter	Cybernetics	<p>A shortwave receiver-transmitter grants you the anacite’s shortwave ability. This acts as telepathy, but only with other creatures with this ability or constructs with the technological subtype.</p>	7	6500	Brain	AA1	11
223	Shotalashu Link Cortex	Biotech	<p>Until recently, only telepathic races with training in how to link their inherent telepathic abilities to shotalashus have been able to consistently form psychic bonds with the beasts. New developments in biotechnology have allowed less-trained telepaths and even non-telepathic members of other races to do so. Using a graft of lashunta brain cells into the your body, you can replicate a lashunta’s limited telepathy, though only in the capacity to link with a shotalashu. This reduces the DC of all Survival skill checks to form the link by 5, but doubles the duration of the dazed condition and damage taken to either the bonded shotalashu or you, should one of you die.</p>	4	2500	Brain	AA2	115

225	Society subdermal graft, signal	Cybernetics	<p>This implant rests underneath the skin of the palm of one hand, or at the end of a tentacle or similar appendage in species that lack hands. The augmentation can be activated or deactivated mentally as a swift action. Activating the implant causes a rendition of the Starfinder Society’s symbol to glow underneath the skin. This augmentation acts as a mark, letting others know you are a member of the Starfinder Society. It also increases the light level within 5 feet by one step while active.</p>	1	150	Hand	SFS1	4
226	Solar overload conduit, mk 1	Cybernetics	<p>This augmentation takes the form of constellations connected with circuitry patterns, either on your palms (if you manifest a solar weapon) or on a large patch of your skin (if you manifest solar armor). Engineered with fanatical devotion to unlocking the potential of stars, solar overload conduits can grant solarians means to amplify their powers.<br/> If you are a solarian with a solar weapon and you have a solarian weapon crystal in your mote, when you hit a target with your solar weapon but do not score a critical hit, as a reaction you can overload your weapon crystal and apply your weapon crystal’s critical hit effect (if any) to the attack (do not roll your damage twice). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the solar overload conduit’s mark, but each time you do so, you immediately become unattuned.<br/> If you are a solarian with solar armor, when you take Hit Point damage from a creature within 100 feet of you, as a reaction you can dismiss your solar armor and send it as an arc of solar energy at the attacking creature, dealing an amount of fire damage equal to the damage dealt to you at the time you discharged your solar armor. The maximum damage you can reflect in this way is equal to 10 times the solar overload conduit’s mark. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the solar overload conduit’s mark, but when you do so, you immediately become unattuned.</p>	5	2640	Skin	DF02	43

229	Sovereign helm	Cybernetics	<p>This strange silvery helm features a glowing band of greenish energy. Four metal clasps attached to long, sharp appendages poke out from the crown of the helm. When the apparatus is held over the head of a Small or Medium living creature for 1 minute, the band of energy pulsates wildly, and at the end of that time, the clasps slap down and start to painlessly burrow into the creature’s cranium. After another full minute, the appendages become fully embedded, and the sovereign helm begins the 24-hour process of rewriting the neural pathways of the subject’s brain. If the helm is removed at any time during this period and then placed back onto the same subject, the 24 hours begin anew. Once this process is complete, the sovereign helm grants the wearer some control over constructs with the technological subtype.<br/> While a sovereign helm has a different method of installation than most augmentations, it acts as a brain system augmentation in all other ways. You can’t wear and make use of a sovereign helm if you have preexisting brain system implantation, nor can you install a brain system implantation while a sovereign helm’s apparatuses are burrowed into your cranium.<br/> Once the sovereign helm has fully rewritten your neural pathways, it allows you to spend a standard action in an attempt to assert some amount of control over a single construct with the technological subtype that you can see within 60 feet of you. A targeted construct must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier); on a failure, it must stop what is doing and can do only what you command (using only the following commands) until the end of your next turn. If the construct succeeds at its saving throw, it is immune to your sovereign helm’s control for 24 hours.<br/> <strong>Full Stop:</strong> The construct cannot do anything until the end of your next turn.<br/> <strong>Move:</strong> On the construct’s next turn, you can decide how it spends its move action.<br/> <strong>Attack:</strong> On the construct’s next turn, you can decide how it attacks.<br/> After the first round a construct has failed its save, you can attempt to maintain your control over it with a move action each round, but the construct can attempt another saving throw. If the construct succeeds, you lose control and the construct is immune to your sovereign helm’s effects for 24 hours. If the construct fails, your control over it continues until the end of your next turn, and you can choose the same or a different command from the list. A sovereign helm allows you to control only one construct at a time.</p>	9	14975	Brain	DS05	41

In addition, you can extrude your squirming entrails from your mouth as a move action and use them almost like an additional limb, though you can’t speak, ingest anything, or hold your breath while doing so. You can retract your squirming entrails as a move action.<br/> Each model of squirming entrails functions differently when extruded: mk 1 squirming entrails help you keep your balance, so you don’t take the normal penalties to attacks or gain the flat-footed condition when you are off-kilter, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to balance. Mk 2 squirming entrails function as mk 1 squirming entrails, except that they also allow you to stand from prone as a swift action.

Mk 4 squirming entrails function as mk 2 squirming entrails and allow you to hold two additional hands’ worth of equipment. Mk 5 squirming entrails function as mk 4 squirming entrails and, when not holding any objects, can perform an attack five times a day identical to that of mk 3 ghoul glands. Squirming entrails that allow you to hold more equipment don’t increase the number of attacks you can make in combat, but they allow you to store a single object of light or negligible bulk inside your body when you retract them. An external examination or a tactile search can’t detect the hidden object, but most security checkpoints include a scan that can detect it.</p>	20	775000	Throat	ARM	96
241	Stench Glands, Mk 1	Necrograft	<p>Stench glands are a concentration of undead sweat glands located mostly in your armpits that can emit a foul, debilitating odor. As a standard action a number of times per day equal to your stench glands’ mark, you can activate the necrograft to form a 10-foot radius cloud of stench centered on you that persists for 1 minute. Living creatures that enter your cloud must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be sickened until they leave the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter. A creature that succeeds at this save is unaffected by your stench for 24 hours. Creatures that do not breathe or use self-contained breathing are unaffected by your stench. You can halt the stench as a swift action.<br/> Mk 4 and mk 5 stench glands produce a particularly loathsome funk that can drive off most creatures. After the first round of being sickened by your stench, a creature in your cloud must succeed at another Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated until it leaves your cloud, after which it is sickened for 1d6+2 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this second Fortitude save remains sickened as normal, but it must continue to attempt a Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated each round it remains in your cloud.</p>	1	200	Skin	ARM	97

The shackle feeds on your tissue, requiring you to eat and drink half again more than usual to sustain it, and it must be attached to flesh. Further, no matter how many arms you have, you can have only one velstrac shackle.<br/> As if drawing a weapon, you can cause the shackle to extend a shadow chain (Starfinder Armory 11–12) of the same model name as the shackle. The shadow chain within the velstrac shackle is magical. It can also be upgraded with weapon fusions like a normal weapon of the velstrac shackle’s level.<br/> Within the shackle, the chain is hidden from casual observation, although someone who searches you can discern the chain’s presence inside the shackle by succeeding at a Perception check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level + your key ability modifier). While you wear the shackle, you are proficient with the shadow chain within, and you cannot be disarmed of or drop the weapon. You can withdraw the chain into the shackle as a swift action or part of a full action. In addition, if the weapon takes damage, you can allocate any healing you receive to it, provided that healing restores your Hit Points.<br/> When your character level is within 2 levels of the next more powerful velstrac shackle, you can upgrade the item to its next level. To do so, you must acquire magical components, including rare minerals from the Shadow Plane, worth the price of the more powerful shackle minus 25% of the value of your current shackle. You then use the components in a 1-hour ritual to upgrade the shackle to the new, higher level. You must also pay to upgrade any weapon fusions you wish to keep on the shadow chain as if transferring each of those fusions to a new higher-level weapon.<br/> Upgrading a velstrac shackle via shadow magic is rumored to be a way to awaken mortal-made shackles to a true connection with velstracs. This awakening can make a shackle that was once safe a source of shadow corruption. Whispers about this dark possibility suggest virtuous users who magically upgrade a shackle are more at risk than those who already have bloodthirsty or wicked tendencies.</p>	8	9100	Arm	SS2	53

The shadow chain within the velstrac shackle is magical. It can also be upgraded with weapon fusions like a normal weapon of the velstrac shackle’s level.<br/> Within the shackle, the chain is hidden from casual observation, although someone who searches you can discern the chain’s presence inside the shackle by succeeding at a Perception check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level + your key ability modifier). While you wear the shackle, you are proficient with the shadow chain within, and you cannot be disarmed of or drop the weapon. You can withdraw the chain into the shackle as a swift action or part of a full action. In addition, if the weapon takes damage, you can allocate any healing you receive to it, provided that healing restores your Hit Points.<br/> When your character level is within 2 levels of the next more powerful velstrac shackle, you can upgrade the item to its next level. To do so, you must acquire magical components, including rare minerals from the Shadow Plane, worth the price of the more powerful shackle minus 25% of the value of your current shackle. You then use the components in a 1-hour ritual to upgrade the shackle to the new, higher level. You must also pay to upgrade any weapon fusions you wish to keep on the shadow chain as if transferring each of those fusions to a new higher-level weapon.<br/> Upgrading a velstrac shackle via shadow magic is rumored to be a way to awaken mortal-made shackles to a true connection with velstracs. This awakening can make a shackle that was once safe a source of shadow corruption. Whispers about this dark possibility suggest virtuous users who magically upgrade a shackle are more at risk than those who already have bloodthirsty or wicked tendencies.</p>	11	25000	Arm	SS2	53
272	Venom Spur	Biotech	<p>You implant a retractable stinger and venom sac into your hand. You can extend this stinger as a swift action but only while you aren’t holding anything in that hand. Attacks with your stinger deal 1d6 piercing damage and automatically inject venom into the target. An affected creature can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) to resist the effects of your venom. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 damage immediately and must attempt a new Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn each round to end the effect. Each time it fails this save, it takes an additional 2d6 damage. Effects such as remove affliction and antitoxin affect this venom as though it were a poison.<br/>Once used, the venom sac doesn’t refill until the next time you rest to regain Stamina Points. While it’s empty, you can still attack with the stinger but can’t envenomate your target.</p>	2	625	Hand	CRB	212
273	Vocal Modulator	Cybernetics	<p>A vocal modulator includes a series of miniature actuators built specifically to reshape your voice box, along with miniature hyper-resonant chambers that dynamically close or open. This allows you to change the pitch, timbre, and tone of your voice. You can more easily imitate accents or pronounce alien languages. When using Disguise to change your appearance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus if the change in your voice also helps your disguise (at the GM’s discretion).</p>	1	125	Throat	CRB	211
274	Voice Amplifier	Cybernetics	<p>A voice amplifier greatly increases the volume of your voice. You can switch a voice amplifier on or off as a swift action.
