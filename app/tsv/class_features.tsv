1	1	Envoy Improvisation	1	<p>As you gain experience, you learn envoy improvisations&mdash;little tricks that bolster allies, confound enemies, or change the ebb and flow of battle using guile, inspiration, or luck. You learn your first envoy improvisation at 1st level, and you learn an additional improvisation at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. The list of envoy improvisations appear here.<br />If an improvisation allows you to grant an effect to an ally, you cannot grant yourself that effect unless the improvisation states otherwise. If an envoy improvisation allows a saving throw to resist its effects or requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + half your envoy level + your Charisma modifier.<br />Some envoy improvisations are language-dependent, mindaffecting, sense-dependent, or some combination of any or all of these. These terms are defined on page 270.</p>	0	CRB	60
2	1	Expertise	1	<p>You are an expert at dealing with challenges that test your skills, be the challenges social or otherwise. At 1st level, when attempting a Sense Motive check, you can roll 1d6 (your expertise die) and add the result of the roll to your check as an insight bonus. You can use this and other expertise abilities as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining. At 5th level, anytime you roll your expertise die, you gain a +1 bonus to the result. At 9th, 17th, and 20th levels, this bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, you roll 1d8 as your expertise die instead of 1d6.<br />Beginning at 9th level, you have even greater expertise with skills to which you can add your expertise die that you have also selected with the Skill Focus feat. For each such skill, once per day when rolling your expertise die to add to that skill, you may roll the expertise die twice and take the better of the two results.</p>	0	CRB	60
3	1	Skill Expertise	1	<p>At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can use expertise with one additional class skill. You must have at least 1 rank in a skill to select it, and it must come from the following list: Bluff (Cha), Computers (Int), Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Engineering (Int), Intimidate (Cha), and Medicine (Int).</p>	0	CRB	60
4	1	Expertise Talent	3	<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose an expertise talent, which gives you an extra option when using a skill with which you have expertise. The list of expertise talents appear here.</p>	0	CRB	60
5	1	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>	0	CRB	60
6	1	True Expertise	20	<p>You gain total mastery over one of your envoy improvisations and can use it with but a thought. When you gain this ability, choose one improvisation you know that has an effect when you spend 1 Resolve Point.<br />As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can gain the improvisation&rsquo;s effect without spending the Resolve Point. This ability has no benefit if the improvisation requires more than 1 Resolve Point.<br />In addition, when you roll your expertise die, you can add 2d8 rather than 1d8+4 to the result of your skill check. If, for some reason, your bonus gained from expertise isn&rsquo;t 1d8+4, you can&rsquo;t use this option.</p>	0	CRB	60
7	2	Artificial Intelligence	1	<p>You construct an artificial intelligence (or AI), a sophisticated program of self-motivated code that you can access for help in a variety of endeavors. This AI is the product of your own genius, far more advanced and complicated than any available for sale to consumers (though it falls short of being truly self-aware), and only you know the secrets of its creation and operation. Your AI can take one of two forms: a drone or an exocortex. You must pick one of these forms upon taking your first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p><h4>DRONE</h4><p>You begin play with a powerful robotic drone to house your AI. You build and control this drone, which accompanies you on your adventures and is capable of combat, espionage, and other specialized tasks. As you gain levels, your drone advances in sophistication and gain additional abilities. While the value of your drone is immense, only you, with your extensive knowledge of its quirks and security measures, can ever hope to operate or repair it.&nbsp;Drones are detailed in Drones beginning on page 74.</p><h4>EXOCORTEX</h4><p>You begin play with an exocortex, an artificial processor that interacts with and augments your biological brain&rsquo;s cognitive functions, which can aid you in a variety of tasks, from combat to digital infiltration. Your exocortex is implanted within your physical body or brain, similar to a piece of cybernetic hardware, allowing your AI to access your mind and feed you information. As you gain levels, your exocortex advances in sophistication and processing power&mdash;see Exocortex on page 79.&nbsp;Only you can access or interact with your exocortex.</p>	0	CRB	68
8	2	Drone	1	<p>You begin play with a powerful robotic drone to house your AI. You build and control this drone, which accompanies you on your adventures and is capable of combat, espionage, and other specialized tasks. As you gain levels, your drone advances in sophistication and gain additional abilities. While the value of your drone is immense, only you, with your extensive knowledge of its quirks and security measures, can ever hope to operate or repair it. Drones are detailed in Drones beginning on page 74.</p>	0	CRB	68
9	2	Exocortex	1	<p>You begin play with an exocortex, an artificial processor that interacts with and augments your biological brain&rsquo;s cognitive functions, which can aid you in a variety of tasks, from combat to digital infiltration. Your exocortex is implanted within your physical body or brain, similar to a piece of cybernetic hardware, allowing your AI to access your mind and feed you information. As you gain levels, your exocortex advances in sophistication and processing power&mdash;see Exocortex on page 79. Only you can access or interact with your exocortex.</p>	0	CRB	68
10	2	Bypass (EX)	1	<p>You are skilled at getting inside computer systems and electronic devices. At 1st level, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Computers and Engineering skill checks. At 5th level, every 4 levels thereafter, and at 20th level, this bonus increases by 1.</p>	0	CRB	68
11	2	Custom Rig (EX)	1	<p>You have created a customized toolkit you can use to hack systems and items. Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic augmentation system in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. For more information on augmentations, see Chapter 7: Equipment. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check you attempt. Some mechanic tricks (see page 71) and drone mods (see page 77) require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit (see Chapter 7: Equipment). Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet. If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks.</p>	0	CRB	68
12	2	Mechanic Tricks	2	<p>As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear.<br />You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier. If a mechanic trick requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your class level + your Intelligence modifier.<br />Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t learn mechanic tricks more than once. The list of mechanic tricks appears on page 71.</p>	0	CRB	68
13	2	Overload (EX)	3	<p>As a standard action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn&rsquo;t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex&rsquo;s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone&rsquo;s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn&rsquo;t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>	0	CRB	68
14	2	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>	0	CRB	68
15	2	Remote Hack (EX)	5	<p>You can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet. A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Perception or Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to determine that you are the origin of this activity.</p>	0	CRB	68
16	2	Expert Rig (EX)	7	<p>Your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls). In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of item level 6th or lower, and it has the features of a computer with a tier equal to half your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices. See page 213 for more information on computers.<br />You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship&rsquo;s downloaded data sets and transponder (see page 430) at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range.</p>	0	CRB	68
17	2	Miracle Worker (EX)	7	<p>As a move action, you can repair damage to a starship&rsquo;s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently. To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.<br /><strong>Armor:</strong>&nbsp;You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor&rsquo;s EAC and KAC for 1 minute.<br /><strong>Weapon:</strong>&nbsp;You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon&rsquo;s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.<br /><strong>Damaged Ship:</strong>&nbsp;You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship's base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship&rsquo;s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship&rsquo;s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships.</p>	0	CRB	68
18	2	Override (EX)	9	<p>Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not dazed and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can&rsquo;t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours.</p>	0	CRB	68
19	2	Coordinated Assault (EX)	11	<p>If you have a drone, whenever both you and your drone make attacks against the same target, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack rolls. If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level.</p>	0	CRB	68
20	2	Advanced Rig (EX)	13	<p>Your custom rig&rsquo;s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.<br />In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship&rsquo;s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>	0	CRB	68
21	2	Control Net (EX)	17	<p>You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><table class="right400"><tbody><tr><th>LEVELS ASSIGNED</th><th>INCREASE TO BASE ATTACK BONUS</th></tr><tr><td>1&ndash;4</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>5&ndash;8</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>9&ndash;12</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>13&ndash;16</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>17&ndash;20</td><td>+5</td></tr></tbody></table>	0	CRB	68
22	2	Ghost in the Machine (EX)	19	<p>When using your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not dazed, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can&rsquo;t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.</p>	0	CRB	68
23	2	Superior Rig (EX)	19	<p>Your custom rig&rsquo;s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.<br />Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>	0	CRB	68
24	2	Tech Master	20	<p>You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 1 minute per item level or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 1 minute per item level. This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a onehanded weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.</p>	0	CRB	68
25	3	Spells	1	<p>You cast spells drawn from the mystic spell list.&nbsp;To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Wisdom modifier.<br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4&ndash;4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4&ndash;5: Mystic Bonus Spells&mdash;note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4&ndash;6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Wisdom modifier.<br />Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br />You can cast any mystic spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem as a full action. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>	0	CRB	83
26	3	Connection	1	<p>You have a mysterious connection with some force that grants you magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic&mdash;once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.<br />Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don&rsquo;t fit within their ethos (for example, Weydan, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>	0	CRB	83
27	3	Connection Power	1	<p>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, you gain a connection power unique to your connection. If a connection power allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier. If the power requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier.</p>	0	CRB	83
28	3	Connection Spell	1	<p>Your connection grants you additional spells known, one for each level of mystic spell you can cast, starting at 1st level and at any level when you normally gain access to a new spell level. These spells are in addition to the spells known listed on Table 4&ndash;6: Mystic Spells Known. These spells can&rsquo;t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels (except in specific cases; see below). The spell level of each spell is listed in your connection&rsquo;s entry.<br />If your connection lists a single variable-level spell (see page 330) for all spell levels at the start of its spells entry, you gain that variable-level spell when you first get your connection spell for each level. The next time you gain a connection spell, add the next higher level of the variable-level spell to your list of spells known. You immediately lose the lower-level version of that variable-level spell and replace it with the listed connection spell for that lower level.</p>	0	CRB	83
29	3	Healing Touch (SU)	1	<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>	0	CRB	84
30	3	Channel Skill (SU)	2	<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks. Each connection has two skills associated with it. You gain a +1 insight bonus to skill checks with your connection&rsquo;s associated skills. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>	0	CRB	84
31	3	Mindlink (SP)	2	<p>You can form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it. You can use mindlink at will as a spell-like ability, though only once per day on any given individual.</p>	0	CRB	84
32	3	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>	0	CRB	84
33	3	Telepathic Bond (SP)	11	<p>As a standard action, you can form a telepathic link with up to six other willing creatures, allowing you to communicate telepathically at great distances. This functions as telepathic bond, except the duration is permanent. You can have only one telepathic bond active in this way at any given time; creating a new telepathic bond immediately ends the previous one.</p>	0	CRB	84
34	3	Transcendence (SP)	19	<p>You are close to becoming one with your connection. You can cast each of your connection spells once per day without consuming a spell slot. In addition, you learn how to temporarily transcend your physical form. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can&rsquo;t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can&rsquo;t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.<br />You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can&rsquo;t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.</p>	0	CRB	84
35	3	Enlightenment (SU)	20	<p>You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a move action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you gain a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers. Any unspent temporary Resolve Points disappear at the end of this minute. In addition, once per week, you can cast miracle as a spell-like ability.</p>	0	CRB	84
36	4	Operative's Edge (EX)	1	<p>Your diverse training as an operative grants you a +1 insight bonus to initiative checks and to skill checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>	0	CRB	93
37	4	Specialization	1	<p>Your specialization represents your primary area of expertise. Pick one specialization upon taking your 1st level of the operative class. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Descriptions of the specializations appear on page 94. Your specialization grants you the Skill Focus feat (see page 161) in your specialization&rsquo;s associated skills, and you gain a free skill rank in each of those skills at each operative level (this does not allow you to exceed the maximum number of skill ranks in a single skill).</p>	0	CRB	93
38	4	Specialization Exploit	5	<p>You gain your specialization&rsquo;s listed exploit as a bonus operative exploit, even if you don&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites.</p>	0	CRB	93
39	4	Specialization Skill Mastery	7	<p>You become so confident in certain skills that you can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When attempting a skill check with a skill in which you have the Skill Focus feat, you can take 10 even if stress or distractions would normally prevent you from doing so.</p>	0	CRB	93
40	4	Specialization Power	11	<p>You gain a special power depending on the specialization you chose at 1st level.</p>	0	CRB	93
41	4	Trick Attack (EX)	1	<p>You can trick or startle a foe and then attack when she drops her guard. As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm. Just before making your attack, attempt a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization; see page 94) with a DC equal to 20 + your target&rsquo;s CR. If you succeed at the check, you deal 1d4 additional damage and the target is flat-footed. This damage increases to 1d8 at 3rd level, to 3d8 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d8 every 2 levels thereafter. You can&rsquo;t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack.</p>	0	CRB	93
42	4	Evasion (EX)	2	<p>If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect. You gain this benefit only when unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, and you lose the benefit when you are helpless or otherwise unable to move.</p>	0	CRB	93
43	4	Operative Exploit (EX)	2	<p>As you gain experience, you learn special tricks called operative exploits. You learn your first operative exploit at 2nd level, and you learn an additional exploit every 2 levels thereafter. If an operative exploit allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. If it requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. The list of operative exploits appear on page 95. You cannot learn the same exploit more than once unless it specially says otherwise.</p>	0	CRB	93
44	4	Quick Movement (EX)	3	<p>As long as you are unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, your land speed increases by 10 feet. At 9th level, your land speed instead increases by 20 feet, and at 15th level, your land speed instead increases by 30 feet.</p>	0	CRB	93
45	4	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>	0	CRB	94
46	4	Debilitating Trick (EX)	4	<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can make the creature flat-footed or off-target until the beginning of your next turn. You might learn exploits that grant you additional options for your debilitating trick, but you can select only one option each time you hit with a trick attack.</p>	0	CRB	94
47	4	Uncanny Agility (EX)	7	<p>You are immune to the flat-footed condition, and your opponent doesn&rsquo;t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you&rsquo;re prone. Furthermore, covering fire and harrying fire don&rsquo;t provide any advantage against you.</p>	0	CRB	94
48	4	Triple Attack (EX)	8	<p>When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, you can make up to three attacks instead of two.</p>	0	CRB	94

50	4	Double Debilitation	17	<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can apply two of the effects from your debilitating trick.</p>	0	CRB	94
51	4	Supreme Operative (EX)	20	<p>Whenever you attempt a skill check with your specialization&rsquo;s associated skills, you can roll twice and take the higher result. Once per day as a move action, you can temporarily trade out one of your operative exploits for another operative exploit requiring the same level or lower. This trade lasts 24 hours. If the exploit you trade away is a prerequisite for any of your other abilities, you lose all abilities that require it as a prerequisite for the duration.</p>	0	CRB	94
52	5	Skill Adept	1	<p>As part of the process that led you to become a solarian, you gained additional insight and training. Choose two additional skills and add them to your list of class skills.</p>	0	CRB	101
53	5	Solar Manifestation (SU)	1	<p>At 1st level, you gain a physical manifestation of your stellar power. The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.<br />Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>	0	CRB	101
54	5	Stellar Mode (SU)	1	<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star&rsquo;s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces&mdash;a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br />When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br />At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you&rsquo;re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you&rsquo;ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br />At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br />When you&rsquo;re not in combat, you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there&rsquo;s any doubt about whether you&rsquo;re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don&rsquo;t pose a real threat to you.</p>	0	CRB	102
55	5	Stellar Revelation	1	<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104).&nbsp;The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br />Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</p>	0	CRB	102
56	5	Sidereal Influence (SU)	3	<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.<br />To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.</p><ul><li><strong>Graviton Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)</li><li><strong>Photon Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</li></ul>	0	CRB	103
57	5	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency. If you selected solar weapon as your solar manifestation, it gains the benefit of Weapon Specialization as if it were an advanced melee weapon.</p>	0	CRB	103
58	5	Flashing Strikes (EX)	7	<p>Your mastery of melee combat allows you to make multiple attacks more accurately. When making a full attack entirely with melee weapons, you take a &ndash;3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal &ndash;4 penalty.</p>	0	CRB	103
59	5	Zenith Revalations	9	<p>At 9th level and again at 17th level, you gain two powerful stellar revelations. Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.<br />Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>	0	CRB	103
60	5	Solarian's Onslaught (EX)	13	<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a &ndash;6 penalty to these attacks instead of a &ndash;4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a &ndash;5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>	0	CRB	103
61	5	Stellar Paragon (SU)	20	<p>You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.<br />In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>	0	CRB	103
62	6	Primary Fighting Style	1	<p>You have a preferred fighting style that represents the type of soldier you are. Each fighting style is composed of various style techniques that you learn as you gain experience. You must pick one fighting style upon taking your first soldier level, and once made, this choice cannot be changed. Descriptions of the fighting styles you can choose from appear on pages 112-115.</p>	0	CRB	111
63	6	Primary Style Technique	1	<p>At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a style technique unique to your primary fighting style.</p>	0	CRB	111
64	6	Combat Feat	2	<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats.<br />Whenever you gain a new bonus feat, you can also choose to replace one of the bonus feats you have already learned with a different bonus feat. The feat you replace can&rsquo;t be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat or other ability. You can change only one feat at any given level, and you must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time you gain the new bonus feat.</p>	0	CRB	111
65	6	Gear Boost	3	<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn a trick called a gear boost that make you better with a particular type of weapon or armor. Choose from the gear boosts listed below. Some gear boosts require you to reach a certain soldier level to select them; this level is indicated in parentheses after the boost&rsquo;s name.</p>	0	CRB	111
66	6	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>	0	CRB	112
67	6	Secondary Fighting Style	9	<p>You choose another fighting style. Once you choose this second style, it cannot be changed.</p>	0	CRB	112
68	6	Secondary Style Technique	9	<p>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a style technique unique to your secondary fighting style. For the purposes of these style techniques, treat your soldier level as equal to your soldier level &ndash; 8.</p>	0	CRB	112
69	6	Soldier's Onslaught (EX)	11	<p>When you make a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a &ndash;6 penalty to these attacks instead of a &ndash;4 penalty.</p>	0	CRB	112
70	6	Kill Shot (EX)	20	<p>As a standard action, you can make a single attack against an enemy. If the attack hits and does not kill your enemy, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to force the creature to succeed at a Fortitude save or die. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability on a creature (regardless of whether or not you forced it to attempt a Fortitude save), that creature is immune to your kill shot for 24 hours.</p>	0	CRB	112
71	7	Spell Cache (SU)	1	<p>As the culmination of your early study of the fundamental forces of the galaxy, you have created a spell cache that allows you to store and access spells. Your spell cache could be a device such as a handheld computer or technological implant; an item such as a ring or staff; or a symbol such as a brand, tattoo, or other permanent modification to your body. While you don&rsquo;t need your spell cache to cast your spells, once per day, you can activate your spell cache to cast any one spell you know and are capable of casting, even if you&rsquo;ve expended all your spell slots for that spell&rsquo;s level.<br />If your spell cache is damaged, it is restored to full Hit Points the next time you prepare spells. If the spell cache is lost or destroyed, you can replace it after 1 week with a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.</p>	0	CRB	119
72	7	Magic Hack	2	<p>You have carefully studied the forces that define magic and can manipulate them. You learn your first magic hack at 2nd level, and you learn an additional magic hack every 3 levels thereafter. When casting a spell, you can apply no more than one magic hack that affects the attributes of a spell (such as distant spell or extended spell). If a magic hack allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your technomancer level + your Intelligence modifier. The list of magic hacks appears starting on page 120.</p>	0	CRB	119
73	7	Spell Focus	3	<p>You gain Spell Focus as a bonus feat.</p>	0	CRB	120
74	7	TechLore (EX)	3	<p>You rewire your mind to give you greater insight into the nature of magic and technology. You gain a +1 insight bonus to Computers and Mysticism checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>	0	CRB	120
75	7	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>	0	CRB	120
76	7	Cache Capacitor (SU)	6	<p>You expand your spell cache into a cache capacitor. As part of regaining your spells each day, you can cast a single spell into your spell cache and have it affect you continuously for 24 hours. The cache capacitor can hold any of the following spells: detect radiation, disguise self, keen senses, or unseen servant. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. When you cast the spell into your cache capacitor, you expend the spell slot normally and make any decisions required for that spell, but the duration doesn&rsquo;t expire for 24 hours. If the spell in your cache capacitor is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it, keeping the same decisions you made when you cast it, and gaining whatever duration the spell had remaining. You can&rsquo;t exchange the stored spell for another spell until you again regains your spells.<br />At 12th level, your cache capacitor gains a second slot that can hold darkvision, lesser resistant armor, life bubble, or spider climb.<br />At 18th level, your cache capacitor gains a third slot that can hold arcane sight, flight (spell level 3rd or lower), see invisibility, or tongues.</p>	0	CRB	120
77	7	Resolve Attunement (EX)	19	<p>You recover Resolve Points when you use powerful magic. Each time you cast a 6th-level spell, you regain 1 Resolve Point, up to your normal maximum. This applies only to spells you cast using your normal 6th-level spell slots, not to those you cast using magic items or other methods such as fuse spells.</p>	0	CRB	120
78	7	Fuse Spells (EX)	20	<p>You can combine lower-level spell slots to cast higher-level spells. As part of casting a spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to exchange a number of unused spell slots for a single spell slot of a higher level; this expends the lower-level spell slots. Add up the levels of the expended slots to determine which higher level of spell you can cast (maximum 6th). For instance, you could exchange three 1st-level slots to cast a 3rd-level spell, or you could exchange two 3rd-level slots to cast a 6th-level spell. If you combine spell slots to cast a 6th-level spell, it doesn&rsquo;t count as such for resolve attunement.<br />Furthermore, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to combine two 6th-level spell slots to cast wish.</p>	0	CRB	120
79	8	Custom Microlab (EX)	1	<p>You have created a small, customized kit consisting of medical supplies, testing materials, and pharmaceutical compounds, which you can use to evaluate medical conditions and perform several additional tasks described below. You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be in your hand to function.<br />Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer (Starfinder Armory 100) and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify. (For more about crafting serums, see page 235 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook.)<br />As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab&rsquo;s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it&rsquo;s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature&rsquo;s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br />You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target&rsquo;s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br />At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.<br />If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>	0	COM	41
80	8	Biohacks (EX)	1	<p>As part of your custom microlab, you keep a specialized micropharmacy of catalysts, nanites, and specialized chemicals, plus a small mixing apparatus and syringes. You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly&mdash;a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br />You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack&rsquo;s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard&rsquo;s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br />You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br />A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they&rsquo;re within your custom microlab&rsquo;s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br />The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don&rsquo;t need to decide which specific biohacks you&rsquo;re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren&rsquo;t used that day become inert, even if they&rsquo;re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br />Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>	0	COM	41
81	8	Injection Expert (EX)	1	<p>You are proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property through a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect. At 2nd level, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with these weapons. At 9th level, that bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level it increases to +3.<br />When you hit an ally with such a weapon, you can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting the ally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, drug, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon. When you fire a weapon with the injection special property and you have multiple types of ammunition loaded into the weapon, you choose which type of ammunition you fire when you attempt the attack.</p>	0	COM	43
82	8	Primary Field of Study	1	<p>Your primary field of study represents your scientific specialty. Choose your primary field of study upon taking your first level in biohacker—once made, this choice cannot be changed. A field of study grants you a unique booster and inhibitor, many of which work only on living creatures (not objects or creatures with the unliving universal creature rule) and have special properties and descriptors explained in their entries. At 5th level, you gain the breakthrough for your field of study.</p>	0	COM	43
83	8	Scientific Method (EX)	1	<p>You have an innate mental gift, and a special way of approaching problems that lets you surpass normal researchers and scholars. If your key ability score is Intelligence, you have a studious mind. If your key ability score is Wisdom, you have an instinctive mind. Your scientific method affects your spark of ingenuity class feature (see below), and may impact how some other class features function, as noted in those abilities.</p>	0	COM	43
84	8	Theorem (EX)	2	<p>As you gain experience, you devise theories about the way the universe works. Some theorems you can apply to yourself, altering your physiological structure to gain specific benefits, while others require the use of your custom microlab or other equipment or add additional options for your biohacks.<br /> You learn your first theorem at 2nd level, and you gain an additional theorem every 2 levels thereafter. If a theorem allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. If a theorem requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t learn a theorem more than once. Once you learn a theorem, that choice cannot be changed.</p>	0	COM	43
85	8	Spark of Ingenuity (EX)	3	<p>Possible permutations and offshoots of your formulas constantly run through your mind. Once per day, you can alter one of your biohacks to work in a different way, determined by your scientific method. You can do this one additional time per day at 9th level and at 15th level.<br />If you are a studious biohacker, you can expend two uses of your biohack ability to combine the effect of two basic or minor biohacks (or one of each) into a single effect. This takes no additional time and allows a creature to be under the effects of two different basic or minor booster or inhibitor biohacks simultaneously. If the two effects have different durations, each effect ends after its normal time limit, though any with a duration measured in rounds last 1 round longer than normal.<br />If you are an instinctive biohacker, when using a booster biohack, you can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster&rsquo;s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or shaken. If you are at least 9th level, you can instead add the off-target condition as one of the effects imposed by any of your inhibitors, or you can remove any one of the following conditions with any of your boosters: dazzled, deafened, fascinated, fatigued, off‑target, shaken, or sickened. Alternatively, you can add the dazzled condition to the effects imposed by any of your inhibitor biohacks. This effect lasts the length of the inhibitor&rsquo;s duration.</p>	0	COM	43
86	8	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with. For weapons you have gained proficiency with only through the injection expert class feature (page 43), rather than the normal Weapon Specialization benefit, you instead add half your character level to damage you deal with those weapons.</p>	0	COM	44
87	8	Second Field of Study	7	<p>You choose a secondary field of study, which must be different from your primary field of study. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain the unique booster and inhibitor biohacks for that field of study. At 11th level, you gain the breakthrough for your secondary field of study. When discussing your eduction, your secondary field of study is often referred to as your &ldquo;minor.&rdquo;</p>	0	COM	44
88	8	Tertiary Field of Study (EX)	13	<p>You choose a third field of study, which must be different from your primary and secondary fields of study. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain the unique booster and inhibitor biohacks for that field of study. At 17th level, you gain the breakthrough for your tertiary field of study.</p>	0	COM	44
89	8	Resolve Analysis (EX)	19	<p>Whenever you use your spark of ingenuity class feature, you regain 1 Resolve Point, up to your normal maximum.</p>	0	COM	44
90	8	Superserum (SU)	20	<p>At 20th level, you have developed the formula for a superserum that can create powerful changes in a target. You can create two superserums per day. Your superserums are a special type of biohack, and you prepare them as part of the 10 minutes required to create your normal biohacks for the day. Your superserum produces one of the following effects; as with all biohacks, you decide on this effect as part of the attack or action you take to inject a creature with the biohack.</p><ul><li>Grant major healing or bring a dead creature back to life. This functions as if you had cast raise dead or regenerate on the target, using your class level as the caster level.</li><li>Scramble the physiological makeup of the target, causing massive internal damage. The target takes 17d10 points of damage and is exhausted and stunned for 1 round. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier), the damage is halved, and the target is instead only fatigued for 1 round.</li><li>Relieve the target of debilitating conditions. Choose one set of ability scores: mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) or physical (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution). The target is healed of all ability damage to the chosen set of ability scores, and all ability drain from these ability scores is removed. Regardless of which set of scores you choose, the superserum also eliminates any ongoing confusion, fear, and insanity effects; any mental afflictions that could be removed with dispel magic; and any diseases that use the mental disease track. It removes any effects magically altering the target&rsquo;s memory&mdash;even instantaneous effects&mdash; and can restore the target&rsquo;s memory to perfect clarity.</li></ul>	0	COM	44
91	9	Entropic Pool (SU)	1	<p>You have the supernatural ability to control matter as it changes states, allowing you to arrest, accelerate, or even reverse the typical course of events. This energy takes the form of a pool of Entropy Points (EP). You can have a maximum number of EP in your entropic pool equal to your Constitution modifier.<br />You can gain Entropy Points only when involved in a combat encounter that includes a significant enemy (Starfinder Core Rulebook 242). When combat begins, you gain 1 Entropy Point at the beginning of your first action; at the end of combat, you lose any Entropy Points you have remaining. In addition to methods granted by vanguard aspects, you can gain Entropy Points in the followings ways.</p><ul><li>While you have no Entropy Points, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to gain 1 EP (2 EP at 10th level).</li><li>Each time you take damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP.</li><li>If you take damage from a critical hit, you gain 1 EP, in addition to any you gain from the attack&rsquo;s normal damage.</li><li>If you score a critical hit on a significant enemy, you gain 1 EP.</li><li>If you take a full action to charge, you gain 1 EP.</li><li>If you take two move actions on the same turn to move your speed each time, you gain 1 EP.</li><li>As a move action, you can designate a willing adjacent ally as an entropic focus. They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of your next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to you or you designate a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If your entropic focus takes damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP. If you are at least 6th level, you can expend a Resolve Point to designate an adjacent, willing ally as your entropic focus as a reaction when they take damage (and gain EP from damage they take from the triggering attack, if appropriate).</li></ul><p>Entropy Points can be expended in various ways, some of which you gain through vanguard aspects and disciplines. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point in your entropic pool, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your Armor Class.</p><ul><li>As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move your speed, you can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it to the speed for any movement type you have).</li><li>As a move action, you can expend EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack you make before the start of your next turn. You must decide how many EP to expend when you take this move action, and you can&rsquo;t expend more EP than your level. If the boosted entropic strike hits, you deal +1d4 damage for every EP expended.</li></ul>	0	COM	51
92	9	Entropic Strike (SU)	1	<p>You can focus the power of entropy into a forceful attack. Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike&rsquo;s item level.<br />You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack&rsquo;s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon&rsquo;s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn&rsquo;t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn&rsquo;t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br />At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table 2&ndash;2: Vanguard). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe&rsquo;s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</p>	0	COM	51
93	9	First Vanguard Aspect 	1	<p>You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics. This aspect grants you an expanded command of the universe around you and teaches you important insights about matters that most people never connect to entropy.<br />You select one vanguard aspect when you take your first level of vanguard. Once made, this choice can’t be changed. Descriptions of the aspects you can choose from appear on pages 53–55. If an aspect ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities), the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier unless stated otherwise.</p>	0	COM	52
94	9	Mitigate (EX)	2	<p>You can control how you are affected by damage or effects that alter damage. As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your vanguard level (to a minimum of 0 damage). If you do, you can&rsquo;t gain any Entropy Points from that attack.<br />Additionally, as a swift action, you can remove any DR or energy resistance you have, or the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases your AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for you. If you end an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, you suspend the listed benefits until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you first come under the effect of an ability or spell that grants you DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, you can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>	0	COM	52
95	9	Vanguard Discipline	2	<p>Your close attention to the multivariate interactions between countless systems of order and disorder, combined with your study of advanced combat techniques, allows you to manipulate reality in devastating ways known as disciplines. You learn your first vanguard discipline at 2nd level and an additional discipline every 2 levels thereafter. The list of vanguard disciplines appears on pages 55–57. Unless otherwise specified, you can’t select the same discipline more than once. If a vanguard discipline allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.</p>	0	COM	52
96	9	Reactive (EX)	3	<p>Once per day, you can take an additional reaction during a single round, though you can still take only one reaction per triggering event. You can take a reaction before the first time you act in a combat, but not in a surprise round in which you are unable to act.<br />At 9th level and again at 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per day, though you can never use this ability to take more than two reactions in a round or one per triggering event.</p>	0	COM	52
97	9	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency. You also gain a special form of weapon specialization for your entropic strike, allowing you to add a bonus to your damage equal to your vanguard class level plus half of any other class levels you have.</p>	0	COM	53
98	9	Entropic Attunement (SU)	5	<p>As you learn to exert finer control over your entropic strike, you can enhance it to devastating effect. The saving throw DC for any of these effects that allow a saving throw is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.<br />At 5th level, choose one of the following weapon special properties: breach, bright, feint, force, or penetrating. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike has the chosen special property.<br />At 7th level, choose one of the following critical hit effects: corrode (1d8 for every 3 vanguard levels you have), knockdown, or staggered. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. Your entropic strike gains this critical hit effect as long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point. If your entropic strike has another critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can choose either the entropic attunement critical hit effect or the other critical hit effect. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Entropy Point to apply both critical hit effects.<br />At 10th level, you can extend your field of entropy far enough that your entropic strike gains the reach weapon special property. The reach granted by this property increases by an additional 5 feet at 13th level, 16th level, and 19th level.<br />At 13th level, just before making an attack, you can spend 2 Entropy Points to grant your next attack the blast weapon special property with a range of 20 feet. At 16th level, this range increases to 30 feet, and at 19th level, it increases to 60 feet.<br />At 16th level, as a standard action you can use your entropic strike to strike the ground or clap your hands together to deal damage in a radius. Make a single melee attack roll and compare the result to the EAC of creatures and objects within 20 feet (other than yourself). You damage each creature and object with an EAC equal to or lower than the attack result. You can expend 1 EP to exclude a number of targets equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).<br />At 19th level, as long as you have 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike gains a second weapon special property, selected from those listed at 5th level. When you score a critical hit with your entropic strike, you can apply either the severe wound critical hit effect or any one of the critical hit effects listed at 7th level.</p>	0	COM	53
99	9	Uncanny Agility (EX)	7	<p>You are immune to the flat-footed condition, and your opponent doesn&rsquo;t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you&rsquo;re prone. Furthermore, covering fire and harrying fire don&rsquo;t provide any advantage against you.</p>	0	COM	53
100	9	Second Vanguard Aspect	8	<p>Your understanding of the many ways entropy can control the physical world expands. Select a second vanguard aspect, which must be different from your first vanguard aspect. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>	0	COM	53
101	9	Flashing Strikes (EX)	11	<p>Your mastery of melee combat allows you to make multiple attacks more accurately. When making a full attack entirely with melee attacks, you take a &ndash;3 penalty instead of the normal &ndash;4 penalty.</p>	0	COM	53
102	9	Uncanny Speed (EX)	15	<p>When making a full attack, you can also take a separate move action to move. The movement can occur before, after, or between the attacks from the full attack. All the movement must occur at the same time. This is a haste effect.</p>	0	COM	53
103	9	Agent of Change (SU)	19	<p>You begin each combat encounter with 3 Entropy Points.</p>	0	COM	53
104	9	Invulnerability (SU)	20	<p>Once per day as a reaction, you become immune to all weapon special properties that impose penalties on you or that grant an attacker bonuses against you, as well as all combat maneuvers, conditions, critical hits, and critical hit effects, and you can take three reactions each round. These benefits last for 1 minute.<br /></p>	0	COM	53
105	10	Spells	1	<p>You cast spells drawn from the witchwarper spell list. To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Charisma modifier.<br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2&ndash;3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2&ndash;4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells&mdash;note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells&mdash;these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&ndash;5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Charisma modifier.<br />Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br />You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.<br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>	0	COM	61
106	10	Infinite Worlds (SU)	1	<p>As a standard action, you can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into your current universe. You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.<br />All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.<br />You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.<br />For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.<br />The environmental and instantaneous effects you can create by sacrificing a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>1st (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li><li><strong>1st (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a &ldquo;1&rdquo;), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li><li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li><li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li><li><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense&mdash;vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration (Core Rulebook 260).</li><li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li><li><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds&rsquo; environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 &times; the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li><li><strong>4th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li><li><strong>5th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li><li><strong>5th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.</li><li><strong>6th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).</li></ul>	0	COM	61
107	10	Paradigm Shift	2	<p>Paradigm shifts represent your ability to briefly install pieces of alternate realities into your own, subtly or radically changing your surroundings for a time. You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.<br />Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level. You can instead select a paradigm shift of a lower level, but note the level of the original paradigm shift so that when you later swap out the same paradigm shift at later levels, you can select any paradigm shift of the original level or lower.)</p>	0	COM	62
108	10	Compound Sight (SU)	3	<p>You can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted dozens of different ways. Choose a skill. You gain a +1 insight bonus to checks using that skill. This bonus increases by +1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. You can change your chosen skill every time you gain a witchwarper level. At 9th level, you become more adept with your compound sight and can choose two skills to apply it to.</p>	0	COM	63
109	10	Weapon Specialization (EX)	3	<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>	0	COM	63
110	10	Alternate Outcome (SU)	6	<p>You can use your grasp of other realities to swap an outcome in your current existence with that of a more favorable reality. As a reaction once per day, you can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that you attempt. Alternatively, you can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against you or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.<br />You gain one additional daily use of this ability at 12th level and again at 18th level.</p>	0	COM	63
111	10	Unfold Existences (SU)	19	<p>You have nearly unlimited insight into all possible worlds and can pluck power from them as you deem necessary. Select five paradigms shifts you don&rsquo;t know but whose prerequisites you meet. These paradigm shifts must not require your level to be higher than 8th. You can use the selected paradigm shifts a total number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>	0	COM	63
112	10	Reality Stutter (SU)	20	<p>Your force of will can infuse reality itself, changing key aspects of existence around you. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use any paradigm shift you know. This doesn&rsquo;t take an action, but you must use this ability on your turn unless the paradigm shift can be used as a reaction. If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can&rsquo;t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn. You can use the unfold existences ability in conjunction with reality stutter; doing so expends a daily use of unfold existences as normal.<br />Furthermore, once per week, you can cast warp reality as a spell-like ability.</p>	0	COM	63
113	1	Combat Expertise (EX)	1	<p>You&rsquo;re able to use your social skills and abilities to gain the upper hand during a confrontation, often depending on deception, misdirection, and pure confidence to defeat your foes instead of brute force. You gain an expertise die of the same value as that granted to an envoy of your level by the expertise class feature, but you do not add it to skill checks. Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Computers, Culture, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive.<br />As a standard action, you can make an expertise attack as an attack action. Prior to your attack roll, attempt a skill check using the chosen skill with a DC equal to 15 + 1-1/2 &times; your target&rsquo;s CR. If you succeed at the check and your attack hits, you roll your expertise die and add the result to your damage roll, and the target is shaken for 1 round.<br />You can use this ability and other expertise abilities as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining. This ability counts as the expertise ability for purposes of other abilities and prerequisites. If an ability requires you to forgo your expertise die on a skill check to gain some other benefit (such as altered bearing), you can use that ability only in a round in which you did not use combat expertise.<br />At 5th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you can select another skill you can use with combat expertise. This counts as having expertise with that skill for purposes of expertise talents and other prerequisites, though you do not actually add your expertise die to any skill checks.<br />This replaces expertise and skill expertise.</p>	1	COM	68
114	1	Magical Expertise (EX)	1	<p>You&rsquo;re a master of Mysticism and exceptionally skilled at identifying and wielding magic. You gain an expertise die of the same value as that granted to an envoy of your level by the expertise class feature. You add Mysticism to your list of class skills, and you add your expertise die to your Mysticism check results instead of your Sense Motive check results.<br />You also gain the following limited version of the mystic&rsquo;s spells class feature. You use your Charisma score in place of your Wisdom score when determining the effects of your spellcasting, including the highest level of spell you can cast and the Difficulty Class for saving throws against your spells. Unlike a mystic, your selection of spells and spells per day is extremely limited. You begin play knowing one 0-level mystic spell, and you can cast your 0-level spells three times per day. At 5th level, you learn one 1st-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. At 9th level, you learn one 2nd-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. At 13th level, you learn one 3rd-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. At 17th level, you learn one 4th-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. Otherwise, this ability functions as the mystic&rsquo;s spells class feature, including the ability to decipher magical inscriptions. You can cast your lower-level spells known using your higher-level spell slots, and you can cast variable-level spells you know using any level of spell slot you have available.<br />This ability counts as the expertise ability for the purposes of other abilities and prerequisites. If an ability requires you to forgo your expertise die on a skill check to gain some other benefit (such as altered bearing), you must expend one of the spell slots you gain from this ability to gain that benefit.<br />In addition, whenever you would gain a new expertise talent, you can instead choose one spell level that is at least one spell level lower than the highest spell level you can cast using this ability. You learn one additional mystic spell of the chosen spell level and increase your spells per day for that spell level by one, to a maximum of four.<br />This ability replaces expertise and skill expertise, and it alters expertise talents.</p>	1	COM	68
115	1	Motivation Expertise (EX)	1	<p>You&rsquo;re an expert at making people happy and high-spirited, allowing them to press forward when they might otherwise quit. You gain an expertise die of the same value as that granted to an envoy of your level by the expertise class feature. At 1st level, whenever you take an action that restores a creature&rsquo;s Stamina Points or Hit Points, you can restore additional Stamina Points equal to the result of the roll of your expertise die. You can still use your expertise die on Sense Motive checks, but you always add the minimum possible result. This is also true for any skills you select with skill expertise.<br />This replaces expertise.</p>	1	COM	68
116	1	Polymorphic Disguise (SU)	1	<p>You&rsquo;re an expert in secret arts that allow you to change your appearance into something&mdash;or someone&mdash;totally different. You gain the shapechanger subtype and the change shape universal monster rule (Starfinder Alien Archive 152). This ability has the polymorph descriptor (Starfinder Alien Archive 2 141), and you must design one polymorph form to use with this ability. You must comply with all restrictions imposed by a 1st-level polymorph spell when designing this form (Alien Archive 2 145), and you can&rsquo;t design a form of a creature that has an Intelligence modifier of &minus;3 or lower. You add your expertise die to Disguise checks to change your appearance to your chosen form.<br />At 5th level, your shapeshifting abilities improve. When you design your form, you must comply with all restrictions imposed by a 2nd-level polymorph spell. This further improves to a 3rdlevel polymorph spell at 9th level, a 4th-level polymorph spell at 13th level, a 5th-level polymorph spell at 17th level, and a 6th-level polymorph spell at 20th level.<br />When selecting expertise talents, you don&rsquo;t need to have expertise in the skills they affect, and you can use any expertise talent that requires you to forgo your expertise die by spending 1 Resolve Point as part of the action to use the expertise talent. In addition, when you would gain an expertise talent, you can instead learn a new polymorph form that you can assume using this alternate class feature.<br />This alters expertise talents and replaces expertise, skill expertise, and true expertise.</p>	1	COM	68
117	2	Experimental Prototype (EX)	1	<p>You construct an experimental prototype, a unique item that represents your research and development into a specific new type of technology. Your experimental prototype can take one of two forms: an armor or a weapon. You must choose one of these forms upon taking your first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it can&rsquo;t be changed.<br />If your experimental prototype is ever destroyed or lost, you retain its schematics in your custom rig and can rebuild a version of it for free using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. This free version is of an item level no greater than your mechanic level &ndash; 2 (minimum 1st level). You can take a single 8-hour rest during each 24 hours spent working, but any interruption greater than a moment of conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to rebuild your experimental prototype. In addition, every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your experimental prototype with the same amount of work, allowing you to change the type of armor or weapon you chose as a basis for your experimental prototype (selecting an item of the same type with an item level no higher than the item level of your previous prototype).<br />Experimental prototype replaces the artificial intelligence (AI) class feature.</p>	1	COM	72
118	3	Epiphanies	1	<p>While most mystics receive powers closely aligned to their connection, a few receive glimpses of supernatural insight that allows them to access different powers. Among mystic scholars, such an insight is generally known as an epiphany. Whenever you would gain a connection power, you can choose an epiphany of equal or lower level instead. For example, when you gain your 3rd-level connection power, you can choose any 1st-level or 3rdlevel epiphany instead of gaining that connection power.<br />If an epiphany allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier. If the epiphany requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier.</p>	1	COM	76
119	4	Marked For Death (EX)	1	<p>You&rsquo;ve been trained with a particular set of abilities to excel at taking down enemies. Your specialization doesn&rsquo;t grant you Skill Focus or free skill ranks with its associated skills. Instead, you can mark for death one opponent within 100 feet that you&rsquo;re aware of as a move action. As long as that target is in sight, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack rolls and the save DC of your operative class features and weapon critical effects against that foe. Marking a target for death focuses all of your attention on that foe, causing you to take a &minus;2 penalty to AC and Reflex saves against attacks and effects that do not originate from the marked foe. You can end this effect as a swift action or a reaction, and designating another target causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous target.<br />At 7th level, whenever you hit a flat-footed foe that you&rsquo;ve marked for death with a trick attack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to force the target to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier). If the target fails this save, any condition you imposed on the target with debilitating trick has a duration of 1 round per operative level you have. If your target succeeds, you still apply all the normal effects of your trick attack.<br />This ability alters specialization and replaces specialization skill mastery.</p>	1	COM	80
120	4	Operative Arsenal (EX)	8	<p>At 8th level, choose one of the following weapon types: advanced melee weapons, longarms, heavy weapons, or any one special weapon of your choice. You gain proficiency with the chosen weapon type (or weapon, if you chose a special weapon). In addition, you can use trick attack with weapons of the chosen type. You do not add trick attack damage to such attacks, but the target is still flat-footed and you can use debilitating trick. At 13th level, you can choose a second type of weapon from the list.<br />This replaces triple attack and quad attack.</p>	1	COM	82
121	4	Quick Cover (EX)	2	<p>You can crouch, minimize your profile, and otherwise maximize the cover you gain in an environment without taking the time to go fully prone or move to hide behind larger objects. By flipping a table to be on its edge, knocking over piles of boxes, spinning to keep your profile behind a light pole, or other actions, you gain cover from objects normally too small to provide cover. Objects that would normally offer no cover instead grant you partial cover, and objects that would normally offer partial cover instead grant you normal cover. This benefit lasts only until you leave your square or the beginning of your next turn, whichever happens first, and to gain the benefit again you must leave your current square.<br />All other rules for determining if an object grants cover against a specific attack still apply. This ability cannot be used to gain improved cover or total cover.<br />This replaces quick movement.</p>	1	COM	82
122	4	Quick Trick (EX)	3	<p>You can make a trick attack as a standard action. You cannot make any other attack during a round when you do this, and cannot take any action that affects or modifies your attack or the weapon you are attacking with.<br />This replaces quick movement.</p>	1	COM	82
123	4	Quick Zero-G Adaptation (EX)	3	<p>You can quickly and easily adapt to the difficulties of operating in zero-g. You reduce the DC for any check required to move in zero-g by 5. In addition, when you use a move action to push off an object in zero-g, you move at your full land speed instead of at half.<br />This replaces quick movement.</p>	1	COM	82
124	4	Stunt And Strike (EX)	1	<p>You can perform skillful stunts while going on the offensive. As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with any weapon you&rsquo;re wielding and are proficient with, even a weapon with the unwieldy property or that requires a full action to make a single attack. Just before making your attack, attempt a skill check with one skill that you have Skill Focus with (DC = 20 + your target&rsquo;s CR). If you succeed at the check, the target is flatfooted against attacks you make using this ability. At any point during the full action, you can also trigger one stunt that you know. The stunt must match the skill you are using for the stunt and strike attack. At 7th level, you can perform two stunts you know. If the stunts use different skills, you must attempt both skill checks, and if either fails, your target is not flat-footed.<br />At 1st level, choose one stunt associated with a skill with which you have Skill Focus. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose another stunt that uses any skill that you have Skill Focus with. If a stunt allows a saving throw, its DC is equal to 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. Each of the skills listed below has several stunts associated with it.<br />This replaces trick attack and debilitating strike.</p>	1	COM	80
125	5	Extra Manifestation	9	<p>You gain a second solar manifestation. You can have only one manifestation active at a time unless you are fully attuned (graviton or photon), in which case you can use two manifestations at once. You must be at least 9th level to select extra manifestations.<br />Extra manifestation replaces one selection of zenith revelations.</p>	1	COM	84
126	6	Aesthetic Warrior	1	<p>You study fighting styles thought lost to the Gap, often recorded only in the art of ancient civilizations or inferred from the shape of relic weapons and battle gear. You focus specifically ancient motions and techniques that rely on form and mobility rather than the harshness of attacks and resilience. You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. You can deal lethal damage with your unarmed strikes, and the attack doesn&rsquo;t count as archaic. At 3rd level, you gain a unique Weapon Specialization with your unarmed strikes, allowing you to add 1-1/2 times your character level to your damage rolls for your unarmed strikes (instead of just adding your character level, as usual). If you can already add 1-1/2 your character level to your unarmed attack rolls (such as due to the vesk natural attack racial trait), you instead can add the block, grapple, and stun weapon special properties to your unarmed strikes.<br />This replaces the soldier&rsquo;s proficiency with heavy armor and heavy weapons.</p>	1	COM	88
127	6	Feat Boost	3	<p>Whenever you would gain a gear boost, you can instead gain a technique called a feat boost that makes you better at using a specific combat feat that you have. All feat boosts require that you have a specific combat feat; this combat feat is indicated in parentheses after the feat boost&rsquo;s name. You cannot select a feat boost at the same level you gain access to its related feat.</p>	1	COM	88
128	6	Special Ops Trainings	3	<p>Whenever you would gain a gear boost, you can instead gain a technique called special ops training that makes you better with one or more skills commonly used to perform special military operations.</p>	1	COM	89
129	7	Cache Augmentation (EX)	1	<p>Your studies of the fundamental forces of the galaxy have enabled you to enhance one of your body&rsquo;s systems to benefit from the energy of stored spells. You might have been bestowed this augmentation by an order of technomancers, implanted the augmentation into yourself as part of your research, or witnessed part of your body undergo a technomantic apotheosis that left you with the ability to cast spells.</p>	1	COM	92
130	7	Cache Hacks (SU)	6	<p>At 6th level, you can acquire a cache hack, a fundamental shift in the focus of your spell cache that alters the spells you can cast with the cache capacitor class feature. Choose one of the cache hacks described on page 93; your cache capacitor can hold the listed spells instead of those described on page 120 of the Core Rulebook.<br />Some of the cache hacks described below allow you to place spells with targets into your cache capacitor. These spells are marked with an asterisk (*). For such spells, you effectively gain the ability to cast the cached spell at will. You don&rsquo;t need to make any decisions required for the spell in advance, but their duration expires normally. Reestablishing one of these spells requires only that you cast the spell again; you don&rsquo;t need to spend 5 minutes reestablishing it. You can have only one instance of each spell active at a time, and casting the spell again causes the previous instance to automatically end, as if its duration had expired. After 24 hours, you lose the ability to cast the spell in your cache capacitor and effects produced by those spells immediately end, as if their duration had expired.<br />Aside from the change in the spell list and the changes listed above, your cache capacitor otherwise functions as described in the cache capacitor class feature. This alters cache capacitor.</p>	1	COM	92
131	7	Hack Capacitor (SU)	6	<p>You can adjust your magical knowledge, granting you the ability to hack your spellcasting in unexpected ways. Select three magic hacks that you do not have but whose prerequisites you meet. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of one of these magic hacks for 1 minute. You can use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use hack capacitor again before the duration expires, you replace the previous magic hack with the new choice. If a magic hack you chose with hack capacitor has a daily use limitation, any uses of any magic hack from your hack capacitor count toward the hack&rsquo;s daily limit. Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one magic hack you selected with this ability with another choice.<br />At 12th level, select a fourth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of two magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 1 Resolve Point (or 2 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day). Both magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose of this ability, so if you use this ability again during the same day, both magic hacks are replaced.<br />At 18th level, select a fifth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of three magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 2 Resolve Points (or 3 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day). All three magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose of this ability. At 19th level, you can use this ability as a swift action or a move action.<br />This replaces cache capacitor and resolve attunement.</p>	1	COM	92
