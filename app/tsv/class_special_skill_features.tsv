id	class_special_skills_id	name	level	description
1	159	Akashic Knowledge (Ex)	1	<p>You gain the channel skill ability at 1st level (instead of 2nd level). Each day when you recover your spell slots, you can tap into the Akashic Record, enabling you to choose one Profession skill and add that to your list of associated skills for the channel skill class feature.</p>
2	159	Access Akashic Record (Su)	3	<p>You can access the Akashic Record to augment your skills. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt a skill check as if you had ranks in that skill equal to your mystic level.</p>
3	159	Peer Into the Future (Su)	6	<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes in uninterrupted meditation to receive visions of possible futures. At any point over the next 24 hours, you can declare that you are using the benefit of this ability before rolling one initiative check, saving throw, or skill check. You gain a +4 insight bonus to that check. At 11th level, you can use this ability twice per day, though you can&rsquo;t use it again until after you&rsquo;ve used your first bonus.</p>
4	159	Mind Probe (Sp)	9	<p>You can use mind probe as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your mystic level, lasting for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves against your mind probe is immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>
5	159	Telepathic Memories (Su)	12	<p>You can share memories at will with allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature. As a full action, you or a linked ally can send a memory of up to 1 minute to as many others in the bond as they choose. Sending a relevant memory counts as a successful aid another attempt for a skill check, even if you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be able to use aid another (to a limit of one such memory per skill check).</p>
6	159	Memory Palace (Su)	15	<p>You assemble an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing your accumulated knowledge. This memory palace has a single shimmering entrance. You can access your memory palace once per day; when you do, the entrance appears within close range. If any creatures or objects that were not part of the memory palace when it was created remain inside it, the entrance remains where it first appeared. Only those you designate can enter the memory palace, and the entrance closes and becomes invisible behind you when you enter. Anyone inside can open the entrance and exit the memory palace at will. The only way to enter and exit the memory palace is via the entrance; even&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=PlaneShift">plane shift</a></em>&nbsp;and similar magic do not access it.<br />You can create any floor plan you desire for your memory palace, up to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your mystic level. Inside, the atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm; outside conditions don&rsquo;t affect the memory palace, nor do conditions inside it pass beyond. There is no furniture other than bookcases, computers, and a few desks and sofas. A number of unseen servants (as per the spell of the same name) equal to half your mystic level serve as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you access it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating&mdash;you don&rsquo;t need to be inside it to alter it.<br />When you gain this ability, choose one skill that can be used with the recall knowledge task. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within&mdash;including you&mdash;a +4 enhancement bonus to skill checks to recall knowledge of that type, and creatures inside the memory palace can attempt checks of that type untrained. At 16th level, and at each level thereafter, choose another skill that can be used with the recall knowledge task to which your memory palace&rsquo;s skill bonus applies.</p>
7	159	Glean Spell (Su)	18	<p>Once per day, you can delve into the Akashic Record to cast a spell from either the mystic or technomancer spell list as if it were on your list of spells known. The spell consumes a spell slot 1 level higher than the level of the spell.</p>
8	162	Empathy (Su)	1	<p>As a full action, you can attempt a Sense Motive check to read the emotions of a particular creature (DC = 20 or 10 + its Bluff modifier, whichever is higher). If you succeed, you learn its general disposition and attitude toward creatures within 30 feet of it, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against that creature for 1 hour. Whether you succeed or fail, after opening your mind to read emotions, you take a &ndash;2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects for 1 minute.</p>
9	162	Greater Mindlink (Su)	3	<p>You can use your mindlink ability on the same creature as many times per day as you wish, and the communication can be both ways, though the maximum of 10 minutes of communication per round still applies.</p>
10	162	Emotionsense (Su)	6	<p>You can detect and locate creatures within 60 feet that have emotions, as if you had blindsense (emotion); see page 262. A creature can keep its emotions calm to avoid detection by this ability by succeeding at a Bluff check with a DC equal to 10 + your Sense Motive modifier, but a creature under the influence of an emotion effect cannot try to avoid detection. Creatures under the effects of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=Nondetection">nondetection</a></em>&nbsp;or similar effects automatically avoid detection by this ability. Unless otherwise stated, constructs and creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower don&rsquo;t have emotions and can&rsquo;t be sensed this way.</p>
11	162	Discern Lies (Sp)	9	<p>You can use&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=DiscernLies">discern lies</a></em>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your mystic level, each time targeting a single creature. This effect lasts 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>
12	162	Greater Emotionsense (Su)	12	<p>Your emotionsense is far more discerning, as if you had blindsight (emotion); see page 262.</p>
13	162	Retrocognition (Sp)	15	<p>You can use&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=Retrocognition">retrocognition</a></em>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability at will. When doing so, you take a &ndash;2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects for as long as you concentrate on&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=Retrocognition">retrocognition</a></em>&nbsp;and an equal amount of time afterward. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to negate this penalty.</p>
14	162	Empathic Mastery (Sp)	18	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=PsychicSurgery">psychic surgery</a></em>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. If you are incapacitated by an effect that&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=PsychicSurgery">psychic surgery</a></em>&nbsp;could remove and have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability on yourself, even without being able to take any actions.</p>
15	165	Healing Channel (Su)	1	<p>You can heal yourself and your allies. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to channel this energy. Healing yourself with channeled energy is a move action, healing an ally you touch is a standard action, and healing all allies within 30 feet is a full action. This energy restores 2d8 Hit Points and increases by 2d8 at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
16	165	Lifelink (Su)	3	<p>At the start of each turn, you can choose an ally within 30 feet who has taken Hit Point damage and transfer her wounds to yourself, dealing an amount of damage up to your mystic level to your Hit Points (bypassing any Stamina Points you may have) and healing the ally&rsquo;s Hit Points an equal amount. This doesn&rsquo;t require any action on your part. You can&rsquo;t prevent or reduce the damage you take from lifelink.</p>
17	165	Healer’s Bond (Sp)	6	<p>As a standard action, you can form a bond with up to three allies, allowing you to constantly sense their condition as per the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=Status">status</a></em>&nbsp;spell. This bond lasts until dispelled or until you create a new healer&rsquo;s bond, which immediately ends the previous one. At 11th level, when you gain the telepathic bond class feature, you also gain the effects of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=Status">status</a></em>&nbsp;on all creatures linked by your telepathic bond.</p>
18	165	Steal Life (Su)	9	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to steal part of a creature&rsquo;s life force and transfer it to yourself or others. You must touch the target (requiring a successful melee attack against its EAC), which deals 1d6 damage for every 2 mystic levels you have (maximum 10d6). Choose an ally within 30 feet; that ally recovers an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage dealt (to a maximum of the foe&rsquo;s remaining Hit Points). Alternatively, you can heal yourself instead, but you restore only a number of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt. If this heals the recipient (you or your ally) up to maximum Hit Points, any excess persists for 1 hour as temporary Hit Points. If your attack misses, you don&rsquo;t lose the Resolve Point.</p>
19	165	Channel Bond (Su)	12	<p>When you use healing channel as a standard action, you can heal an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature as if you were touching that ally, as long as the ally is within 120 feet. When you use healing channel as a full action, it heals all allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature within 120 feet (as well as all other allies within 30 feet).</p>
20	165	Channel Life (Su)	15	<p>If you use healing channel on a creature that has died within 1 round, you can bring it back to life as per a 5th-level&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=MysticCure">mystic cure</a></em>&nbsp;spell.</p>
21	165	Deny Death (Su)	18	<p>You are immune to death effects and negative levels. If you would normally die from damage, as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can immediately spend all of your remaining Resolve Points to instead stay alive. If your Hit Points would have been reduced to 0, you now have 1 Hit Point instead. Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t regain Resolve Points again until you rest for 8 hours, even if you have another means to do so.</p>
22	168	Share Pain (Su)	1	<p>Whenever a foe deals damage to you, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to shift some of the pain back onto that foe. Unless the foe succeeds at a Will save, reduce the damage you take from the attack by your mystic level (to a maximum of the attack&rsquo;s damage), and the foe takes an equal amount of damage. This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>
23	168	Backlash (Su)	3	<p>Whenever a foe succeeds at a Will save against one of your spells and completely negates the effect, that foe takes 1 nonlethal damage for each mystic level you have. This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>
24	168	Sow Doubt (Su)	6	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create uncertainty in the mind of a foe within 30 feet. You choose whether the target becomes flat-footed, becomes off-target, takes a &ndash;2 penalty to saving throws, or takes a &ndash;2 penalty to skill checks. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your mystic level, unless the target succeeds at a Will save to reduce the duration to just 1 round. A creature can be affected only by one sow doubt effect. If you use this ability on the same creature again, the new effect replaces the old effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
25	168	Mental Anguish (Su)	9	<p>As a standard action, you can tweak the pain centers in the brain of a foe within 60 feet, causing it to suffer intense agony. The target must succeed at a Will save or be nauseated for 1 round. Regardless of the save, the creature becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>
26	168	Mindbreaking Link (Su)	12	<p>Whenever you or an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature scores a critical hit against a foe, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to confuse that foe. The foe must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1 round. Whether or not it succeeds at this save, the target is affected by your sow doubt ability for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
27	168	Mindkiller (Su)	15	<p>As a standard action, you can mold the subconscious fear of a foe within 60 feet into a psychic image of the most disturbing creature imaginable to the target. Only the target can see the mindkiller, and if the target succeeds at a Will save to recognize the image as unreal, the mindkiller has no effect. If the target fails this Will save, the mindkiller touches the target, which must then succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. On a successful Fortitude save, the target instead takes 3d6 damage. Once a creature succeeds at either save against this ability, it becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
28	168	Explode Head (Su)	18	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to psychically assault the brain of a foe within 60 feet, causing incredible pressure to build in its head. If the target has 20 Hit Points or fewer, its head explodes, instantly killing the target and spreading debris in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage from the flying debris. A target with more than 20 Hit Points takes 1d6 damage per mystic level you have (maximum 20d6), but can attempt a Fortitude save to take only half damage. If this damage would reduce the target to 0 HP, the target&rsquo;s head explodes as described above. This ability works only on a creature that has a head and would die from the loss of a head.</p>
29	169	Inexplicable Commands (Su)	1	<p>When one of your mind-affecting charm or compulsion spells or spell-like abilities ends, the target loses all memory that it was magically controlled or influenced. That creature still remembers the actions it took, but may be confused by them.</p>
30	169	Forced Amity (Sp)	3	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to shunt positive emotions and thoughts through your connection, forcing a humanoid creature to become friendly to you for a time. This functions as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=CharmPerson">charm person</a></em>.</p>
31	169	Echoes of Obedience (Su)	6	<p>Even creatures that resist your dominance can&rsquo;t shake the lingering echoes of your mind. When a creature succeeds at a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting charm or compulsion spells or spell-like abilities and negates the effect, it takes a &ndash;1 penalty to AC, attack rolls, and skill checks until the beginning of your next turn. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
32	169	Greater Forced Amity (Sp)	9	<p>Your forced amity ability functions as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=CharmMonster">charm monster</a></em>.</p>
33	169	Jealous Overlord (Su)	12	<p>When an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature is subject to mind-affecting effect that issues commands, as a reaction you can issue a countermand allowing the linked ally to act normally. When you do, attempt an opposed Charisma check against the originator of the mind-affecting effect; if you succeed, your ally can act normally.</p>
34	169	Forceful Commands (Su)	15	<p>When you use a mind-affecting charm or compulsion spell or spell-like ability against a target benefiting from an active spell that protects against your attack, you automatically become aware of the presence of such defenses, and can spend 1 Resolve Point as part of casting the spell to attempt a caster level check to dispel the highest-level such spell, as if you had cast&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=DispelMagic">dispel magic</a></em>.</p>
35	169	Absolute Control (Su)	18	<p>When you issue a command to a dominated creature that would force it to act against its nature, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to deny it a new saving throw against your domination. The dominated creature still won&rsquo;t carry out an obviously self-destructive order.</p>
36	170	Walk the Void (Su)	1	<p>You are immune to the harmful environmental effects of outer space and vacuum. You also gain a fly speed of 20 feet while in space. In addition, whenever you can see the stars, you can determine your precise location. Finally, add Piloting to your list of class skills.</p>
37	170	Starlight Form (Su)	3	<p>You can transform yourself into blazing starlight as a standard action. Your body sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius, and you gain the benefits of concealment (20% miss chance). At 7th level, a creature that ends its turn adjacent to your starlight form must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. You can maintain your starlight form for a number of minutes per day equal to your mystic level; this duration does not need to be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. You can forgo the ability's concealment and blinding aspects to instead simply shed light, though this still counts against the ability&rsquo;s duration for the day.</p>
38	170	Stargazer (Su)	6	<p>You can study the stars to gain a bit of good luck. Twice per day, if you are outdoors and can see the stars, you can reroll a failed ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check (see page 243).</p>
39	170	Starflight (Su)	9	<p>While in starlight form, you gain the ability to fly as per the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=Flight">flight</a></em>&nbsp;spell (spell level 3rd or lower).</p>
40	170	Starry Bond (Su)	12	<p>You can share the good fortune of your stargazer class feature with your allies. Whenever an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature fails an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to enable your ally to reroll the failed check (see page 243). This ability otherwise functions as the stargazer class feature.</p>
41	170	Meteor Shower (Su)	15	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to call down a rain of meteorites in a 10-foot-radius vertical cylinder, 40 feet high, at a range of up to 250 feet. The meteorites deal 12d6 damage to every creature in the area (Reflex half). Half the damage is bludgeoning damage; the other half is fire damage. If you are outdoors and can see stars, the meteorites instead deal 12d10 damage.</p>
42	170	Interplanetary Teleport (Sp)	18	<p>At 18th level, once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to use&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=InterplanetaryTeleport">interplanetary teleport</a></em>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. If you have been to a location in another star system before, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to use&nbsp;<em><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/spells/?page=InterplanetaryTeleport">interplanetary teleport</a></em>&nbsp;to travel there, even though it exceeds the spell&rsquo;s normal range.</p>
43	171	Speak with Animals (Su)	1	<p>You can communicate with any creature of the animal type, though this doesn&rsquo;t make it friendly. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do you favors. This ability allows you to use Intimidate to bully animals, and you can use any other language-dependent effect against animals.</p>
44	171	Grasping Vines (Su)	3	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to cause an area within 100 feet to sprout writhing vines in a 20-foot-radius spread. The target surface must be solid but does not need to be capable of sustaining plants normally. The vines have a reach of 5 feet and attempt to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area; such a creature must succeed at a Reflex save or gain the entangled condition. Creatures that successfully save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must attempt a new save at the end of your turn each round. Creatures moving into the area must attempt a save immediately; failure ends their movement and they become entangled. An entangled creature can break free as a move action with a successful Acrobatics check or DC 15 Strength check. The vines last for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level, and the entire area is difficult terrain while the effect lasts. At 11th level, the vines can reach 10 feet and sprout thorns that deal 1d6 piercing damage each round to creatures in the area.</p>
45	171	Animal Adaptation (Su)	6	<p>As a standard action, you can modify your body. Choose one of the following to gain the noted benefit: elongated legs (increase your land speed by 10 feet), fins and webbed digits (granting you a swim speed equal to half your land speed), suckers on wrists and feet (granting you a climb speed equal to half your land speed), or vertical-slit pupils (granting you darkvision 60 feet). This ability lasts for a number of minutes per day equal to your mystic level; this duration doesn&rsquo;t need to be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Your base form and size are largely unchanged, but some of your body parts are altered. Armor and gear you are wearing adjusts to your new shape for the duration of this ability. You can have only one of these adaptations active at a time; choosing a new adaptation is a standard action and the new choice replaces the old. At 12th level, the climb and swim speeds granted by your adaptation are equal to your land speed, and you add wings (granting you a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability) to the list of possible adaptations.</p>
46	171	Reactive Resistance (Su)	9	<p>The first time each day you would take energy damage, you immediately gain resistance 10 to that energy type for the remainder of the day. (If you are damaged by more than one energy type simultaneously, choose which type you resist.)</p>
47	171	Share Resistance (Su)	12	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature resistance 5 to the same energy type that you can resist through your reactive resistance class feature for 1 minute. You can&rsquo;t use this ability if your reactive resistance class feature has not yet been activated for the day.</p>
48	171	Plant Transport (Su)	15	<p>Once per day as a full action, you can enter any living plant equal to your size or larger and exit from another plant of the same kind in the same solar system, regardless of the distance separating the two. The destination plant does not need to be familiar to you. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you merely designate direction and distance and this ability moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, this ability fails and you are ejected from the entry plant. You cannot travel through plant creatures. You can bring along objects as long as their bulk doesn&rsquo;t exceed your Strength score. You can also bring up to five willing Medium or smaller creatures (each carrying no more bulk than their Strength scores) with you, provided they are linked to you with joined hands.</p>
49	171	Guided Rebirth (Su)	18	<p>As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can spend all your remaining Resolve Points as a full action to surround yourself with an organic cocoon. While enclosed in the cocoon, you are considered helpless. Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to animal, humanoid (of any subtype), or your original type, gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate. This change does not alter your ability scores, Hit Points, Stamina Points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Each time you make this transformation, you are cleansed of all poisons and diseases, are restored to full Hit Points and Stamina Points, and heal all ability damage. You must select a type other than your current type every time you make the transformation. You can use this ability once per day. Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t regain Resolve Points until you rest for 8 hours, even if you have another means to do so.</p>
50	407	Minor Booster	1	<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn’t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don’t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.<br />At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the drug or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat disease, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the disease, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>
51	407	Minor Inhibitor	1	<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>
52	408	Booster	1	<p>You temporarily boost a living creature (one that does not have the unliving universal creature rule) to improve the acuity of its hearing, granting the subject the benefits of blindsense (sound) with a range of 60 feet. If the creature already has blindsense, it instead gains the benefit of the Blind‑Fight feat. This benefit lasts for 60 minutes.</p>
53	408	Inhibitor	1	<p>You deliver a DNA-twisting or material-altering chemical nanite compound into a creature’s body, imparting vulnerability to one type of energy (your choice). If the creature is immune to that energy type, this inhibitor temporarily removes that immunity and gives the creature resistance 20 to that type of energy. If the creature has resistance to that energy type, this effect instead reduces its resistance by 10 (minimum 0). This biohack does not remove a creature’s resistance or immunity to natural hazards or environments, only to damage from energy attacks, spells, and other abilities.</p>
54	408	Gene Therapy (Ex)	1	<p>As a standard action, you can create and deliver a medicinal formula to a living creature that suspends the effects of damage to their mind and body. When injected, the formula allows the target to ignore the effects of all ability score damage and drain for 10 minutes. If you are at least 7th level, this effect lasts for 1 hour. If you are at least 13th level, it lasts for 24 hours.</p>
55	409	Booster	1	<p>You boost a creature’s immune system, granting a +2 enhancement bonus to Fortitude saving throws.</p>
56	409	Inhibitor	1	<p>You deliver a potent compound that weakens a creature’s immune system (or creates vulnerabilities in nonliving creatures), imparting a –2 penalty to Fortitude saving throws.</p>
57	409	Suppress Disease (Ex)	1	<p>As a standard action, you can create and deliver a formula that supercharges a target’s immune system. When injected, the formula allows the target to ignore the effects of the highest stage (not including the disease’s end state) of a single disease affecting them for 1 hour. The disease doesn’t progress normally during that time, but this time doesn’t count toward the disease’s duration. If you are at least 7th level, the target ignores the effects of the highest stage of a single disease for 24 hours. If you are at least 13th level, the target ignores the effects for 1 week.</p>
58	410	Booster	1	<p>You bolster the chemistry of a creature’s brain (or other cognitive system), allowing it to ignore the effects of the confused and staggered conditions for the booster’s duration. While the creature is ignoring these effects, the duration of the condition elapses as normal.</p>
59	410	Inhibitor	1	<p>You deliver a strong chemical admixture that interferes with a creature’s neurons (or equivalent), imparting a –2 penalty to Will saving throws.</p>
60	410	Boost Neurotransmitters (Ex)	1	<p>As a standard action, you can create and deliver a compound that causes a surge of cognitive activity. When injected into a creature, the formula grants the target a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against mind‑affecting effects for 1 minute. If the target is already subject to a mind-affecting effect, the target can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 enhancement bonus against the effect. This does not grant a new saving throw if the effect did not originally allow one.</p>
61	411	Booster	1	<p>You deliver a coagulant to a living creature, granting it immunity to the bleeding condition for the duration of this effect. If the creature is under the effect of the bleeding condition when you administer this biohack, that condition ends.</p>
62	411	Inhibitor	1	<p>You introduce a mild hallucinogen into a living creature’s body, making it difficult for the target to move or act. The target gains the encumbered condition and must succeed at a Fortitude save or also gain the entangled condition. This is a mind-affecting poison effect.</p>
63	411	Alleviate Pain (Ex)	1	<p>As a standard action, you can create and deliver a formula to a living creature to prevent pain and nausea. When injected, the mixture provides the target with a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against pain effects and effects that cause the sickened or nauseated condition. This bonus lasts for 1 minute. If the target is already under one of these effects, or if it already has the sickened or nauseated condition, it can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 enhancement bonus to end the effect or remove the condition. This does not grant a new saving throw if the effect did not originally allow one. If you are at least 7th level, the bonus to saving throws against pain effects and effects that cause the sickened or nauseated condition increases to +6, or +4 for targets already afflicted and attempting a new saving throw. If you are at least 13th level, this automatically removes the sickened condition, and the bonus to new saving throws for the other conditions increases to +6.</p>
64	412	Booster	1	<p>You cause a living creature to sweat a foul secretion. Any living creature attacking the affected target with a natural attack takes a –2 penalty to the attack. This penalty is a poison effect. If the attacker has active environmental protections (such as those provided by most armor), the penalty applies only after the attacker has hit and damaged the target once.</p>
65	412	Inhibitor	1	<p>You deliver a weak toxin into a living creature’s body, imparting the sickened condition. This is a poison effect.</p>
66	412	Suppress Poison (Ex)	1	<p>As a standard action, you can create and deliver a formula to a living creature that holds the course of a toxin in check. When injected, the formula allows the target to ignore the effects of the highest stage (not including the poison’s end state) of a single poison affecting that creature for 1 minute. The poison doesn’t progress normally during that time, but this time doesn’t count toward the poison’s duration. If you are at least 7th level, the target ignores the effects of the highest stage of a single poison for 10 minutes. If you are at least 13th level, the target ignores the effects of all stages of a single poison for 1 hour.</p>
67	421	Armor Prototype Proficiency (EX)	1	<p>You gain proficiency in heavy armor. Your armor prototype’s hardness, HP, and save bonuses are calculated as if its item level were 5 higher.</p>
68	421	Calibrate Defenses (EX)	1	<p>While wearing your experimental armor prototype, you can bolster your defenses against certain attacks. As a move action, you analyze the weapons and attack patterns of one enemy you can see, programming your armor prototype with this information to improve your ability to defend against that enemy. You gain a +1 shield bonus to AC against the next attack from that opponent, as long as it occurs before the end of your next turn. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and to +3 at 16th level. Calibrating your defenses against another enemy causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous enemy’s attacks.</p>
69	421	Extra Upgrade (EX)	1	<p>Your armor prototype’s efficient design allows you to install one additional armor upgrade beyond what that armor’s upgrade slots would normally allow. You must purchase the upgrade to be installed in this slot at its normal price.</p>
70	421	Power Boost (EX)	5	<p>You gain proficiency in powered armor. You can alter your experimental armor prototype to be identical to any suit of powered armor that has an item level equal to or lower than your existing armor prototype by spending 8 hours of work making upgrades.</p>
71	421	Advanced Customization (EX)	7	<p>You apply a single armor upgrade with an item level of no more than half your mechanic level to your experimental armor prototype at no cost. This customization does not take up an armor upgrade slot. You select an additional upgrade at 11th, 14th, and 17th levels. Each time you gain a level, you can swap out any of these armor upgrades for different upgrades, subject to the same restrictions.</p>
72	421	Versatile Design (EX)	10	<p>Long hours of research and tinkering has taught you how to modify your experimental armor prototype on the fly. Your armor prototype grants you one of the following benefits: +1 to attack rolls, a fly speed of 50 feet (average maneuverability), a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability), a swim speed of 30 feet, or darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. With 10 minutes of work, you can change the ability granted by your prototype to any other one of these abilities.</p>
73	421	Energy Sheild (EX)	15	<p>Your experimental armor prototype gains an energy shield with a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your mechanic level. This shield remains active until all of its temporary Hit Points are depleted. These temporary Hit Points are fully restored when you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.</p>
74	421	Defense Matrix (EX)	20	<p>You perfect your experimental armor prototype’s adaptable defenses, bolstering your armor against a greater number of enemies. You can use your calibrate defenses ability to gain a bonus to your AC against a number of targets equal to your Intelligence modifier, spending a move action for each calibration.</p>
75	422	Weapon Prototype Proficiency (EX)	1	<p>You gain proficiency in advanced melee weapons, heavy weapons, or longarms. Once this choice is made, it can’t be changed. Your weapon prototype must be a weapon of this type. Your designated weapon prototype calculates its hardness, HP, and saves as if its item level were 5 higher.</p>
76	422	Superior Firepower (EX)	1	<p>When you attack with your experimental weapon prototype, you can enhance its damage dealt to select foes. As a move action, you calibrate your weapon prototype to deal additional damage to one enemy you can see. You gain an insight bonus equal to your mechanic level to damage on all attacks against the designated target. Calibrating your weapon against another enemy causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous enemy.</p>
77	422	Improved Magazine (EX)	1	<p>Your experimental weapon prototype can carry more ammunition than a normal weapon of its type. If it contains individual darts, petrol, rounds, shells, or similar physical ammunition, its capacity is doubled. If it uses batteries, it can hold two batteries of the normal size for that weapon, drawing charges from either.</p>
78	422	Enhanced Prototype Proficiency (EX)	5	<p>You can use your prototype weapon with one hand without penalty, even if it is normally a two-handed weapon.</p>
79	422	Advanced Customization (EX)	7	<p>You can apply one of the following weapon special properties to your experimental weapon prototype. You can apply only special properties that are applicable to the weapon you&rsquo;re using, so you couldn&rsquo;t (for example) add quick reload to a weapon that doesn&rsquo;t use charges or ammunition. The GM is the final arbiter of what can be applied to any weapon. Choose from: aurora, block, breach, breakdown, bright, disarm, echo, extinguish, feint, injection, harrying, penetrating, quick reload, recall, stun, trip.<br />At 11th level, you can add a second weapon special property from that list, or you can add force as a second weapon special property. Alternatively, instead of adding a second property, you can add a critical hit effect from the following list, which applies in addition to any other critical hit effect that applies to the attack: arc (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), bind, bleed (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), corrode (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), deafen, knockdown. You may add this even if the weapon already has a critical hit effect, and on a critical hit both effects apply. A weapon cannot have two versions of the same critical hit effect.<br />At 17th level, you can instead add the blind, demoralize, wound, sicken, or staggered critical hit effect in place of a second weapon property or a critical hit effect.<br />Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can switch any of these customizations for a different customization, but you must always choose at least one customization from the 7th-level list.</p>
80	422	Versatile Design (EX)	10	<p>Long hours of research and tinkering have taught you how to modify your weapon prototype on the fly. Select four weapon fusions of a level your prototype weapon qualifies for. Your weapon gains one of these fusions without it counting against the total item levels of fusions it can have. With 10 minutes of work, you can change the weapon fusion currently installed in your weapon prototype to another of your selected fusions. If a fusion selected with this ability has a limited number of uses, using it counts against the uses of any other fusion you access with this ability. Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can change the four fusions you have selected.</p>
81	422	Dual Chambers (EX)	15	<p>You modify your experimental weapon prototype to deal multiple types of damage. Select one additional type of weapon damage that your weapon does not normally deal. When you attack with your experimental weapon prototype, you can deal either type of damage or both. Switching between damage types, or switching your weapon to deal both, is a move action. Each time you gain a level, you can switch your secondary damage type, but you can’t change the weapon’s original damage type without crafting a new experimental weapon prototype.</p>
82	422	Target-Rich Environment (EX)	20	<p>You enhance your experimental weapon prototype’s attack power, allowing you to deal extra damage to multiple enemies. You can use your superior firepower ability to deal additional damage to a number of targets equal to your Intelligence modifier, taking a move action to calibrate it against each foe.</p>
83	440	Nimble Stunt	1	<p>You ignore nonmagical difficult terrain during your stunt and strike. At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point when you use stunt and strike to also ignore magical difficult terrain.</p>
84	440	Operative's Kip-up	1	<p>If you use stunt and strike while prone, you can stand up from prone without using an action and are immune to the off-kilter condition until the start of your next turn. If you have Kip-Up, the moxie racial trait, or a similar ability, you are also immune to the prone condition until the start of your next turn.</p>
85	441	Knock Down	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone.</p>
86	441	Mighty Leap	1	<p>When you use stunt and strike, you gain a fly speed equal to 30 feet or your base speed (whichever is less) with average maneuverability. If you aren’t on solid ground at the end of your turn, you fall.</p>
87	441	Pummel Through	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, instead of causing the target to become flatfooted, you can push the target 5 feet away from you, as if you had succeeded at a bull rush combat maneuver attempt.</p>
88	441	Wall Dasher	1	<p>You can walk on walls and ceilings during your stunt and strike, functioning as spider climb except your climb speed is equal to your base speed and you don’t need to have any hands free. If you aren’t on solid ground at the end of your turn, you fall.</p>
89	442	Clever Retreat	1	<p>You can use stunt and strike to withdraw rather than press the offensive. You can move up to twice your speed, and your actions don’t trigger reactions until the start of your next turn. When using stunt and strike in this way, you can’t attack as part of the action, nor can you cause foes to become flat-footed.</p>
90	442	Feinting Stunt	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, your target is flat-footed against all attacks until the start of your next turn.</p>
91	442	Step-up	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, your target also takes a −2 penalty to saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>
92	443	Blindsense	1	<p>Whenever you attempt a Computers check as part of your stunt and strike and succeed, instead of causing the target to become flat-footed, you gain blindsense (computers) 30 feet until the start of your next turn. This allows you to detect any creature carrying items that can be used with the Computers skill or can be connected to an infosphere (including personal comm units).</p>
93	443	Dirty Trick	1	<p>Whenever you attempt a Computers check as part of your stunt and strike and succeed, you can cause the target to gain one of the following conditions until the start of your next turn instead of the flat-footed condition: blinded, deafened, entangled, off-target, shaken, or sickened (your choice).</p>
94	444	Analyze	1	<p>Whenever you attempt a Culture check as part of your stunt and strike and succeed, you can learn one of the following pieces of information about the target, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 by which your check’s result exceeds the DC: archetypes*, class*, class features*, first language, place of origin, spells known*, or training in a Profession skill. For items marked with an asterisk (*), if the target has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as one piece of information.</p>
95	444	Distracting Blather	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, your foe is off-target until the start of your next turn. This is a language-dependent effect.</p>
96	444	Wordless Pidgin	1	<p>You can wordlessly relay information to any allies within 30 feet who can see you. This works like the limited telepathy ability (as the lashunta racial trait), except it is an extraordinary ability. Onlookers can decipher your wordless communication with a successful Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × your operative level).</p>
97	445	Robotic Beatdown	1	<p>Any attacks you make against constructs or objects during your stunt and strike bypass an amount of hardness or DR the construct has equal to half your operative class level (minimum 1, to a minimum DR or hardness of 0).</p>
98	445	Selective Explosions	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed and your attack is made with a weapon that targets an area (such as a weapon with the automatic, blast, explode, flexible line, or line properties), you can select a number of squares up to your Dexterity modifier and remove them from the affected area.</p>
99	446	Ammo Drop	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, instead of causing a target to gain the flatfooted condition, you can reload one weapon you’re carrying without requiring an action.</p>
100	446	Swift Toss	1	<p>During a stunt and strike, drawing a weapon with the thrown property requires no action, and ranged attacks you make with thrown weapons don’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
101	446	Swipe	1	<p>If your stunt and strike is made with a melee weapon and the skill check and attack roll succeed, you take one easily accessed item from the target’s body, instead of causing them to be flat-footed, and are then holding it. This includes anything the target is not wielding which they could draw as a move action or less. You must have a hand free to use this stunt.</p>
102	447	Hidden Strike	1	<p>If your stunt and strike skill check succeeds, your movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity from your target.</p>
103	447	Sniper's Stunt	1	<p>If you were hidden at the start of your turn and have cover or concealment at the end of your turn, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide as if you were using the sniping task of the Stealth skill.</p>
