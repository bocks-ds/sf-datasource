1	1	Brace Yourselves (Ex)	2	<p>As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies gain a +1 morale bonus to AC if adjacent to at least one other ally, as you all position yourselves so that your armor protects you better. The bonus persists even if the enemy moves beyond 60 feet or out of line of sight or hearing.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant this bonus to AC against attacks made by all enemies within 60 feet.</p>
2	1	Clever Feint (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can fake out an enemy within 60 feet, making that enemy open to your attacks. Attempt a Bluff check with the same DC as a check to feint against that enemy (though this isn&rsquo;t a standard check to feint, so Improved Feint and Greater Feint don&rsquo;t apply). Even if you fail, that enemy is flat-footed against your attacks (see page 276) until the end of your next turn. If you succeed, the enemy is also flat-footed against your allies&rsquo; attacks until the end of your next turn. You can&rsquo;t use clever feint against a creature that lacks an Intelligence score.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Bluff check for clever feint as if it were a success.</p>
3	1	Coordinated Reload (Ex)	2	<p>As a move action, you can grant a single move action to an ally within 60 feet. The ally can use that move action during her next turn to reload or draw a weapon. As part of the move action to activate this ability, you can also reload or draw a weapon. If the ally is adjacent to you, she can draw weapons and use ammunition you are carrying as though she were carrying them herself. The ally can use her extra move action in between her other actions, as well as before or after a full action. A character can use no more than one bonus action from coordinated reload or similar abilities (such as the quick quaff and hurry envoy improvisations) in a single round.</p>
4	1	Dispiriting Taunt (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can taunt an enemy within 60 feet. Attempt an Intimidate check with the same DC as a check to demoralize that enemy (though this isn&rsquo;t a check to demoralize, so you can&rsquo;t use abilities that would apply to a demoralization attempt, like the rattling presence expertise talent). If you fail, that enemy is off-target (see page 276) until the end of your next turn. If you succeed, that enemy is instead shaken (see page 277) until the end of your next turn. This is an emotion and fear effect.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Intimidate check for dispiriting taunt as if it were a success.</p>
5	1	Don’t Quit (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can signal a single ally within 60 feet. That ally ignores one condition (see page 273) of your choice until the start of your next turn, chosen from the following list: confused, fascinated, fatigued, shaken, sickened, and staggered.<br />While your ally doesn&rsquo;t suffer the effects of the condition during that period, the condition is merely suppressed, not removed, and its effects resume at the start of your next turn. The condition can still be removed with spells, technology, and other effects as normal.<br />At 6th level, add the following conditions to the list: cowering, dazed, exhausted, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, and stunned.<br />At 12th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to remove the condition with this ability instead of suppressing it. You can&rsquo;t remove a condition with a permanent duration (see page 271) in this way; if you attempt to do so, your attempt fails but you don&rsquo;t lose the Resolve Point.</p>
6	1	Expanded Attunement (Ex)	2	<p>You can use beneficial mind-affecting envoy improvisations to aid allies who usually would not be able to gain benefits from mind-affecting effects, such as constructs, robots, and undead. If the improvisation grants a morale bonus, even allies who can&rsquo;t normally benefit from morale bonuses gain that bonus.</p>
7	1	Fire Support (Ex)	2	<p>When you take a standard action to provide harrying fire and hit the AC of 15 required to do so, you also provide covering fire for the next ally attacked by the target of your harrying fire attacks before your next turn.<br />Additionally, as a full action, you can make two ranged attack rolls against two different targets, taking a &ndash;4 penalty to each attack roll, to apply harrying fire to each target hit. For each target that you successfully apply harrying fire to, you also provide covering fire for the next ally that is attacked by either target before your next turn.</p>
8	1	Frustrating Target (Ex)	2	<p>You duck and weave around an opponent in close combat, making it difficult for others to draw a bead on you. Once per turn as a move action, choose a significant enemy you are adjacent to. All other enemies take a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls against you until the beginning of your next turn, as long as you are still adjacent to the designated opponent.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when an enemy other than the designated opponent attacks you to make that enemy roll twice on a single attack and take the worse result, as a long as you are still adjacent to the designated opponent. Both of these rolls take the &ndash;1 penalty imparted by this ability.</p>
9	1	Get ’Em (Ex)	2	<p>As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls made against that enemy. The bonus persists even if the enemy moves beyond 60 feet or out of line of sight or hearing.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant this bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against all enemies who are within 60 feet.</p>
10	1	Inspiring Boost (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can signal an ally within 30 feet who has taken damage from any attack made by a significant enemy (see page 242) at any point after your last turn ended. That ally regains a number of Stamina Points (up to his maximum) equal to twice your envoy level + your Charisma modifier; at 15th level, this increases to three times your envoy level + your Charisma modifier. Once an ally has benefited from your inspiring boost, that ally can&rsquo;t gain the benefits of your inspiring boost again until he takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to add your envoy level to the number of Stamina Points regained.</p>
11	1	Look Alive (Ex)	2	<p>When you spend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest, all allies who stay within 60 feet of you throughout the rest gain a +2 morale bonus to Perception and initiative checks for the next hour or until the next 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, whichever comes first.</p>
12	1	Not in the Face (Ex)	2	<p>As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. That enemy must succeed at a Will save or take a &ndash;4 penalty to all attacks it makes against you until the end of your next turn.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make the enemy take the penalty with no saving throw allowed.</p>
13	1	Phalanx Fighting (Ex)	2	<p>Whenever you or an ally within 10 feet of you is wielding a shield (see page 124), as a move action you can grant yourself and all allies within 10 feet of that ally the benefits of that shield until the start of your next turn.</p>
14	1	Quick Quaff (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can grant a single standard action to an ally within 60 feet. The ally can use that action during her next turn to draw or drink a serum (Core Rulebook 225) or draw or inject a spell ampule. As part of the action to activate this ability, you can also draw a serum or spell ampule, or if you used a standard action, drink a serum or inject a spell ampule. If the ally is adjacent to you, she can draw serums and spell ampules that you are carrying as though she were carrying them herself. The ally can use her extra action in between her other actions, as well as before or after a full action. A character can use no more than one extra action from quick quaff or similar abilities (such as the coordinated reload or hurry envoy improvisations) in a single round.</p>
15	1	Spell Gem Understanding (Su)	2	<p>You can use spell gems as if you were a spellcaster. For purposes of using spell gems, you treat all spells on the mystic, technomancer, and witchwarper spell lists as your class&rsquo;s spell list, and you use Charisma as your key ability score for your spellcasting. Your effective caster level for any spell gems you use is equal to your envoy level.</p>
16	1	Superior Covering Fire (Ex)	2	<p>When you take a standard action to provide covering fire and hit the AC 15 required, the target of your covering fire gains the circumstance bonus provided by your covering fire against all attacks attempted against them until the start of your next turn.<br />Additionally, as a full action you can make two ranged attack rolls to provide covering fire to two different allies, taking a &minus;4 penalty to each attack roll. For each target that you successfully apply covering fire to, the circumstance bonus provided by your covering fire applies against all attacks attempted against that ally until the start of your next turn.</p>
17	1	Universal Expression (Ex)	2	<p>When using a language-dependent improvisation that affects an enemy, you can use the improvisation against that enemy even if the two of you do not share a language.</p>
18	1	Watch Your Step (Ex)	2	<p>When an ally within 60 feet must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid a harmful effect, as a reaction before your ally attempts the saving throw, you can grant the ally a +2 bonus to that saving throw.<br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to have the ally roll twice on the saving throw and take the better result. Both of those rolls benefit from the +2 bonus provided by this ability.</p>
19	1	Clever Attack (Ex)	4	<p>You can make an attack that throws your enemy off-balance. As a standard action, you can make a single attack against a target within 60 feet and gain the benefits of clever feint (attempting a Bluff check against the target as normal). Apply the effects of clever feint before resolving your attack. You must have the clever feint envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation.</p>
20	1	Duck Under (Ex)	4	<p>You can duck under a foe&rsquo;s melee attack, causing it to overextend and move into a position more favorable to you. You must take the total defense action (see page 247) to use this ability. If, before the start of your next turn, a foe misses you with a melee attack, as a reaction you can attempt a reposition combat maneuver with a +8 bonus to your attack roll against that foe.</p>
21	1	Exacly As I Would Have Done	4	<p>Your keen tactical mind predicts when and where an ambush would be ideal so you aren&rsquo;t surprised when enemies exploit the same strategy. You aren&rsquo;t flat-footed during a surprise round.<br />At 8th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to share this benefit with one ally you could have reasonably warned of the attack at the last minute; this application of the improvisation is a language-dependent, mind-affecting, sense-dependent effect.</p>
22	1	Focus (Ex)	4	<p>As a standard action, you can encourage a single ally within 60 feet to focus on the danger at hand. If that ally is flat-footed or off-target, you end that condition. If circumstances would cause the ally to immediately become flat-footed or off-target again, you instead suppress that condition for 1 round.</p>
23	1	Hurry (Ex)	4	<p>As a standard action, you can grant a single move action to an ally within 60 feet. The ally can use that move action during her next turn to take a guarded step, move up to her speed, or draw or sheathe a weapon. The ally can use her extra move action in between her other actions, and she can even use it before or after a full action. A character can use no more than one extra action from hurry in a single round.</p>
24	1	Infuriating Target (Ex)	4	<p>You move with skill and grace in combat, using others as living shields. When you use frustrating target, you also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws against area effects as long as you are still adjacent to the designated opponent. If your designated opponent is also within the same area of effect, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to their Reflex save. You must have the frustrating target improvisation to choose this improvisation.<br />At 8th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction whenever you attempt a Reflex save against an area effect to have that area expand to encompass your designated opponent, as long as you are adjacent to it. The opponent&rsquo;s Reflex save takes a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>
25	1	Long-Range Improvisation (Ex)	4	<p>Double the range of your improvisations with ranges of at least 30 feet.</p>
26	1	Martyr's Improvisation (Ex)	4	<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re reduced to 0 Hit Points, as a reaction before gaining the dying condition, you can immediately use any one of your envoy improvisations that can be used as a standard action, move action, or reaction. Once you have used this improvisation, you can&rsquo;t use this ability again until you have regained Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.</p>
27	1	Quick Dispiriting Taunt (Ex)	4	<p>You can use dispiriting taunt as a move action instead of a standard action. You must have the dispiriting taunt envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation.</p>
28	1	Quick Inspiring Boost (Ex)	4	<p>You can use inspiring boost as a move action instead of a standard action, though when you do so, the number of Stamina Points your ally recovers is reduced by your envoy level. You must have the inspiring boost envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation.</p>
29	1	Sudden Shift (Ex)	4	<p>As a reaction, whenever you or an ally deal damage to an opponent within 60 feet of you, you and all allies within 60 feet of the opponent can take a guarded step as a reaction. All of the characters who took a guarded step using this improvisation have their speed reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn.</p>
30	1	Terrifying Blast (Ex)	4	<p>When you throw a grenade, each creature within the radius of the explosion that fails its Reflex save against the grenade and takes damage from it must succeed at a Will save or gain the shaken condition for 1 round. This is a fear effect.</p>
31	1	Watch Out (Ex)	4	<p>As a reaction, when an enemy makes a ranged attack against an ally within 60 feet of you, you can warn that ally of the danger. You must spend your reaction when the enemy declares the attack but before it makes the attack roll. Your ally can spend a reaction to gain a +4 to AC against the triggering attack. Once the triggering attack is resolved, the ally falls prone.<br />At 8th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to prevent your ally from falling prone after the attack.</p>
32	1	Bedside Manner (Ex)	6	<p>When you make a Medicine check to treat deadly wounds or successfully aid another for another creature&rsquo;s Medicine check to treat deadly wounds, if the Medicine check is successful you can add your Charisma bonus to the number of Hit Points recovered as a result of the skill check. Additionally, when you make a Medicine check to treat disease or treat drugs or poison, or successfully aid another for another creature&rsquo;s Medicine check to do so, if the Medicine check is successful, the saving throw bonus granted by the skill checks increases to +6. If the associated saving throw succeeds, it counts as two consecutive successes for the purposes of curing the intended affliction</p>
33	1	Clever Improvisations (Ex)	6	<p>The first time you would spend Resolve Points on one of your envoy improvisations, reduce the cost by 1 Resolve Point (minimum 0). This ability refreshes whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points and after an 8-hour rest to recover Resolve Points, reducing the Resolve Point cost of your next envoy improvisation after the rest.</p>
34	1	Coordinated Barrage (Ex)	6	<p>As a move action, choose one ally within 60 feet. That ally gains the benefit of the Coordinated Shot feat. If the chosen ally already has this feat, they do not grant foes cover against attacks made by you and your allies. The effects of this improvisation last until the start of your next turn.</p>
35	1	Coordinated Flankers (Ex)	6	<p>As a move action, you can coordinate your allies into effective flanking partners. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies count as flanking any creature that at least two of you threaten, regardless of your position</p>

This penalty remains even if you and an enemy move more than 100 feet away from each other, and enemies that weren&rsquo;t within 100 feet when you used draw fire don&rsquo;t take the penalty if they later come within range.</p>
37	1	Heads Up (Ex)	6	<p>When you succeed at a Perception check, as a reaction, you can signal a single ally within 60 feet. That ally can act as if he had also succeeded at the Perception check with the same result.</p>
38	1	Improved Get ’Em (Ex)	6	<p>Your morale bonus from get &rsquo;em increases to +2. As a standard action, you can make a single attack against a target within 60 feet. You and your allies within 60 feet gain the benefits of get &rsquo;em against that target (applying these effects before making the attack roll). As with get &rsquo;em, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant the benefits against all enemies within 60 feet. You must have the get &rsquo;em envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation.</p>
39	1	Inspiring Oration (Ex)	6	<p>You can use inspiring boost as a full action. If you do, all allies within 60 feet of you regain a number of Stamina Points equal to twice your envoy level + your Charisma modifier (up to their maximum); at 15th level, this increases to three times your envoy level + your Charisma modifier. Once an ally has benefited from your inspiring boost or inspiring oration, that ally can&rsquo;t gain the benefits of either improvisation again until they recover Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.<br />As with the inspiring boost envoy improvisation, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to add your envoy level to the number of Stamina Points regained. You must have the inspiring boost improvisation to select this improvisation.</p>
40	1	Trust Your Gear (Ex)	6	<p>As a move action, you can select an ally within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, that ally gains one of the following benefits: he can treat the armor check penalty of his armor as 4 lower than normal (to a minimum of 0); he can ignore the penalties for using armor or a weapon he is not proficient with; or he can ignore the broken condition of an item he is wearing or using.</p>
41	1	Coordinated Maneuvers (Ex)	6	<p>Whenever an ally within 60 feet attempts to use a combat maneuver against an opponent, as a reaction you can signal weak points in the opponent&rsquo;s defenses. The ally gains a morale bonus to their attack roll for that combat maneuver equal to 1d4+1. Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.</p>
42	1	Desperate Defense (Ex)	8	<p>As a move action, you can cause one ally adjacent to you to not be considered helpless (see page 276) for the purpose of actions that can be used only against helpless creatures (such as a coup de grace).

43	1	Expert Attack (Ex)	8	<p>As a move action, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to add your bonus from expertise to your next attack roll before the end of your turn.</p>
44	1	Hidden Agenda (Ex)	8	<p>You&rsquo;re an expert at veiling your true thoughts and goals. Whenever a creature attempts a Sense Motive check to detect a deception of yours, the creature must roll twice and take the worse of the two results. When you attempt a saving throw against an effect or ability that would read your thoughts or reveal your motives, you can roll twice and take the better of the two results.</p>

The chosen ally can immediately attack the target creature with one weapon they&rsquo;re currently wielding as a reaction. If they do, the chosen ally takes a &minus;4 penalty to their attack roll and is staggered until the end of their next turn. Characters who can&rsquo;t be staggered can&rsquo;t benefit from this improvisation. Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.</p>
49	1	Situational Awareness (Ex)	8	<p>If you ready an action, once before the trigger you selected occurs, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to change both the trigger and the action you have ready. You must ready an action that takes the same kind of action as your originally readied action, or you must ready a lesser action. (For example, if you readied a standard action, you could switch to another standard action, a move action, or a swift action, and if you readied a move action, you could switch to another move action or a swift action.)</p>
50	1	Sustained Determination (Ex)	8	<p>As a move action, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to grant an ally within 60 feet 1 Resolve Point that he can spend to empower one of his abilities, even if he has spent all of his own Resolve Points.

51	1	Coordinated Charge (Ex)	12	<p>Whenever you or an ally within 60 feet of you charges an opponent, you can signal all allies within 60 feet of the charging character as a reaction. Signaled characters can also charge the opponent as a reaction if the distance between the character and the charged opponent is equal to or less than the signaled character&rsquo;s speed. All characters that charge an opponent using this improvisation are staggered until the end of their next turn. Characters who can&rsquo;t be staggered can&rsquo;t benefit from this improvisation. Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.</p>
52	1	Fusion Resonance (Su)	12	<p>As a standard action, choose yourself or one ally within 60 feet. The chosen character must be within 10 feet of you or another ally that is within 60 feet of you. Until the end of the chosen character&rsquo;s turn, they can choose one weapon fusion on a weapon wielded by an ally within 10 feet of them. The chosen character applies the benefits of the chosen weapon fusion on all weapon attacks they make until the end of their next turn. This fusion doesn&rsquo;t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the chosen character&rsquo;s weapons can have at once.</p>
53	4	Additional Skill Expertise (Ex)	3	<p>Choose another skill in which you have at least 1 rank from the list of skills you can choose with the expertise class feature; you can use expertise with that skill. You can choose this talent up to three times, choosing a different skill each time.</p>
54	4	Altered Bearing (Ex; Disguise)	3	<p>You can quickly adjust your posture, your stride, your demeanor, and the way your clothes and gear fit, causing casual observers to fail to recognize your true appearance. When you attempt a Disguise check to alter minor details of your appearance, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a move action. You don&rsquo;t reduce the DC by 5 for attempting to alter only minor details, and if an observer succeeds at an opposed Perception check that pierces your disguise, he also realizes your true race and what features you have disguised. You can&rsquo;t use this ability for more complex disguises.</p>
55	4	Analyst (Ex; Sense Motive)	3	<p>You have been taught to carefully consider your own assumptions, making it much less likely you assign false motives to other creatures. When using Sense Motive to detect deception or discern a secret message, as long as your expertise die roll result is not a 1, you don&rsquo;t think a truthful statement contains deceptions or infer false information from a secret message even if you fail your check by 5 or more.</p>
56	4	Battlefield Medic (Ex; Medicine)	3	<p>When you attempt a Medicine check to stop bleed damage or administer first aid to a dying creature, you can choose not to roll your expertise die in order to also automatically treat deadly wounds on that creature if your Medicine check is successful. The DC for the check is based on the medical equipment used, using the DC for treat deadly wounds + 5. This does not count as the treat deadly wounds treatment for the purposes of how many times per day a creature can receive this treatment, though a creature can only benefit from battlefield medic once per day. If you also have the surgeon expertise talent, you can increase the DC of a battlefield medic-related Medicine check by a total of 10 to use battlefield medic to treat deadly wounds on a creature one additional time per day (which does not count as a use of the surgeon expertise talent).</p>
57	4	Biometric Implants (Ex; Disguise)	3	<p>You have small implants that make microscopic alterations to your DNA, allowing you to attempt a Disguise check in place of Computers or Engineering to defeat biometric locks. If you have access to another creature&rsquo;s biometric data, you can duplicate it automatically and open biometric locks keyed to them.</p>
58	4	Borrowed Guise (Ex; Disguise)	3	<p>While you are wearing or wielding one or more items with a combined bulk of 1 or more that you have taken from another creature, you can more readily assume a false identity, disguising yourself as a creature of the same race or organization. You don&rsquo;t need a disguise kit to attempt a Disguise check to change your appearance when using this expertise talent, though using one grants you a +2 bonus to your check. If you forgo rolling your expertise die, changing your appearance takes only 1d3 minutes rather than 1d3 &times; 10 minutes.<br />Alternatively, if you have the materials that qualify for you to use this expertise talent, you may forgo your expertise die to attempt to disguise yourself as that exact creature. Anyone who knows that creature well gains a +10 bonus to Perception checks to oppose your disguise.</p>
59	4	Cautious Expertise (Ex; see below)	3	<p>Choose a skill you have selected with the skill expertise class feature. When you take 20 (see page 133) with this skill, you can roll your expertise die twice and take the better result.<br />You can choose this talent up to three times, choosing a different skill selected with the skill expertise class feature each time.</p>
60	4	Computer Whiz (Ex; Computers)	3	<p>When you attempt a Computers check, you can choose not to roll your expertise die until later. After you determine what the check&rsquo;s result would be, you can choose to either roll your expertise die and add it to the total or forgo the expertise die and reroll the check (Core Rulebook 243). At 9th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to both reroll the check and add the result of your expertise die.</p>
61	4	Convincing Liar (Ex; Bluff)	3	<p>When you attempt a Bluff check, you can choose not to roll your expertise die until later. After you determine what the check&rsquo;s result would be, you can choose to either roll your expertise die and add the result to the total or forgo the expertise die and reroll the check (see page 243). At 9th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll the check and add the result of your expertise die.</p>
62	4	Create Diversion (Ex; Bluff)	3	<p>When you attempt a Bluff check to create a diversion, you can forgo rolling your expertise die. If you succeed at the check, all your allies within 60 feet also count as having succeeded at creating a diversion until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
63	4	Cultural Savant (Ex; Culture)	3	<p>As long as you have enough time, you can take 20 on Culture checks to recall knowledge, even if you don&rsquo;t have access to a computer terminal or other means of research.</p>
64	4	Cunning Disguise (Ex; Disguise)	3	<p>When you attempt an initial Disguise check, you can forgo rolling your expertise die. Instead, the first time a creature would pierce your disguise with a Perception check, treat its result as if it had rolled a natural 1 on its Perception check. This benefit applies only once per disguise. At 9th level, this ability also applies against the second creature who pierces your disguise.</p>
65	4	Demolition Expert (Ex; Engineering)	3	<p>When you attempt an Engineering check to arm or disable an explosive, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a full action (rather than the normal required time of 1 minute to arm an explosive or 2d4 rounds to disarm an explosive).</p>
66	4	Effortless Innuendo (Ex; Bluff)	3	<p>When you attempt a Bluff check to pass a secret message, you can forgo rolling your expertise die to pass your secret message to all allies within 60 feet, instead of just to a single ally. In addition, anyone overhearing your message must roll their Sense Motive checks twice and use the lower result when attempting to learn the gist of the message.</p>
67	4	Engineering Adept (Ex; Engineering)	3	<p>When you attempt an Engineering check to disable or repair a device, you can forgo rolling your expertise die to instead halve the time it takes to make the attempt.</p>
68	4	Expert Advice (Ex)	3	<p>When you are using the aid another action to help a creature succeed at a skill check with a skill in which you have expertise, you can forgo rolling your expertise die. If your aid another attempt succeeds, roll your expertise die and add the result of the roll as an insight bonus to the assisted creature&rsquo;s check in addition to the +2 bonus granted by a successful aid another attempt.</p>
69	4	Expert Distraction (Ex; Bluff)	3	<p>Whenever you attempt a Bluff check to create a distraction, you can forgo rolling your expertise die. If you do and your skill check succeeds, you can add your expertise die to whichever skill task you attempt as part of the diversion (either a Stealth check to hide or a Sleight of Hand check to palm an object). If you forgo adding your expertise die to a Bluff check to create a distraction that you attempted using the Diversion feat and succeed at your Bluff check, you add your expertise die to every Stealth check to hide that your allies attempt.</p>
70	4	Expert Forger (Ex; Computers)	3	<p>You have a database of electronic seals and predesigned templates that allow you forge an official document in a matter of moments. When you attempt a Computers check to create a forgery, as long as you have access to a computer, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a full action (rather than the normal required time of 1d4 minutes).</p>
71	4	Fast Hack (Ex; Computers)	3	<p>When you attempt a Computers check to hack into a computer system, you can forgo rolling your expertise die to instead halve the time it takes to make the attempt (to a minimum of 1 round). At 9th level, if you successfully hack the system, you can also negate a single countermeasure protecting that computer system. You cannot use this talent to negate a countermeasure from the same computer again for 24 hours.</p>
72	4	Gregarious Mien (Ex; Diplomacy)	3	<p>You can positively change a creature&rsquo;s attitude using the Diplomacy skill by one additional category (or two, for a maximum of four, if you spend the extra time) within a 24-hour period. When doing so, you must forgo your expertise die on the Diplomacy check to change the creature&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
73	4	Improvise Surgery (Ex; Medicine)	3	<p>You can improvise most basic medical instruments, allowing you to perform rudimentary surgeries without a medical kit. You can use the Medicine skill to treat deadly wounds without a basic medkit or to provide long-term care to a single patient without an advanced medkit. If you have a basic medkit, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Medicine checks to treat deadly wounds. If you have an advanced medkit, you gain a +2 insight bonus to Medicine checks to treat deadly wounds, and any temporary medical lab you establish using an advanced medkit acts in all ways as an actual medical lab. If you attempt a Medicine check that normally has its DC set by what equipment you use, you use the DC of a basic medkit, or an advanced medkit if you are 5th level or higher.</p>
74	4	Inspired Medic (Ex; Medicine)	3	<p>When you attempt a Medicine check, you can choose not to roll your expertise die until later. After you determine what the check&rsquo;s result would be, you can choose to either roll your expertise die and add it to the total or forgo the expertise die and reroll the check (see page 243). At 9th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to both reroll the check and add the result of your expertise die.</p>
75	4	Keen Observer (Ex; Sense Motive)	3	<p>Whenever you interact with a creature under a mental effect for at least 1 minute, the GM attempts an automatic secret Sense Motive check for you without your expertise die. On a success, you learn about the mental effect. If you specifically request a Sense Motive check to sense mental effects, you can attempt a Sense Motive check as normal, including your expertise die, in addition to this automatic check.</p>
76	4	Likely To Be Right Here (Ex; Sense Motive)	3	<p>You can use subtle cues to anticipate the location of a creature. While you are aware of a creature&rsquo;s presence (Core Rulebook 260), you can use your Sense Motive bonus to attempt Perception checks to search for that creature. Alternatively, you can forgo your expertise die to use your Sense Motive bonus to attempt Perception checks to search an area.</p>
77	4	Maneuver Expertise (Ex; Combat Expertise)	3	<p>You&rsquo;re exceptionally skilled at all manner of self-defense, allowing you to easily perform and defend against combat maneuvers. Choose one combat maneuver. When resisting this combat maneuver, you gain a bonus to KAC equal to the minimum result of your expertise die. Additionally, if you attempt an attack roll to resolve the chosen combat maneuver, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as part of the action to add your expertise die to the attack roll&rsquo;s result as an insight bonus. Once you have added this bonus to a combat maneuver attack roll, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you have regained Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.<br />You must have the combat expertise alternate class feature to select this expertise talent. You can take this expertise talent multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take it, it applies to a different combat maneuver.</p>
78	4	Master of Disguise (Ex; Disguise)	3	<p>Whenever you attempt a Disguise check, you can forgo adding your expertise die to your skill check to reduce the total penalty you take for having altered your appearance by an amount equal to your envoy level, to a minimum penalty of 0. This penalty reduction applies only to disguises that change your appearance in the following ways: alter minor details, add major features, disguise yourself as a different race of the same creature type, or disguise yourself as a different creature type.</p>
79	4	Menacing Gaze (Ex; Intimidate)	3	<p>When you attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize foes, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt to briefly demoralize a small group as a full action. You attempt an Intimidate check against foes within 60 feet, no two of which can be more than 20 feet apart. The DC of this check is equal to the highest DC to demoralize any one of the foes. If you are successful, the targets gain the shaken condition (see page 277) for 1 round (even if your result exceeded the DC by 5 or more). Once you use this ability against a creature, it is immune to this talent for 24 hours.</p>
80	4	Miracle Worker (Ex; Medicine)	3	<p>Your high spirits and unrelenting resolve to save lives allows you to pull your patients from the brink of death, even in dire circumstances. If you succeed at a Medicine check to treat deadly wounds and exceed the DC by 5 or more, you add your Charisma modifier in addition to your Intelligence modifier to the amount of Hit Points restored. If you forgo your expertise die on a Medicine check to treat deadly wounds and exceed the DC by 5 or more, your target regains an additional 1d8 Hit Points. This increases to 3d8 at 4th level, 5d8 at 7th level, 12d8 at 10th level, 16d8 at 13th level, or 20d8 at 16th level.</p>
81	4	Rattling Presence (Ex; Intimidate)	3	<p>When you attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent, you can forgo rolling your expertise die to automatically increase the duration of the shaken condition by 1 round on a successful check. At 9th level, you instead increase the duration by 2 rounds on a success when using this talent.</p>
82	4	Reasonable Excuse (Ex; Bluff)	3	<p>You can speak with such conviction that you earn the benefit of the doubt even under outlandish circumstances. When caught in a compromising situation that clearly indicates your guilt or would initiate combat, you can attempt an immediate Bluff check before initiative is rolled to lie and absolve yourself, but you must forgo your expertise die on this check. A successful check will stop an outbreak of violence as long as you (and anyone with you) is cooperative with those you are lying to (for example, leaving a restricted area or handing over stolen property you happen to &ldquo;find&rdquo;). You cannot use this ability to escape consequences for violence and other overtly hostile actions.</p>
83	4	Saving Expertise (Ex; Special)	3	<p>Choose a saving throw with which you have a base bonus of +3 or higher. Whenever you attempt a saving throw of the chosen type and determine the result (but before you learn the outcome), you can spend 1 Resolve Point to either roll your expertise die and add the result to the total or reroll the saving throw (Core Rulebook 243).</p>
84	4	Skilled Linguist (Ex; Culture)	3	<p>You can speak and read a number of bonus languages equal to your ranks in Culture. Additionally, when you attempt a Culture check to decipher writing, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a full action (rather than the normal 1 minute) per approximately 250 words of writing or fewer.</p>
85	4	Slick Customer (Ex; Diplomacy)	3	<p>When you attempt a Diplomacy check, you can choose not to roll your expertise die until later. After you determine what the check&rsquo;s result would be, you can choose to either roll your expertise die and add it to the total or forgo the expertise die and reroll the check (see page 243). At 9th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to both reroll the check and add the result of your expertise die.</p>
86	4	Stone-Faced Liar (Ex; Bluff)	3	<p>You deliver lies in a monotone as naturally as any other routine communication. When you attempt a Bluff check to lie, you can forgo your expertise die to make the DC of your Bluff check equal to 10 + the target&rsquo;s total Sense Motive bonus, even if the target is suspicious of you. At 9th level, you can instead spend 1 Resolve Point to use the above DC, add your expertise die instead of forgoing it, and ignore the modifier the DC would have if the target is unfriendly to you.</p>
87	4	Student of Technology (Ex; Engineering)	3	<p>As long as you have the time to do so, you can take 20 (see page 133) on Engineering checks to identify creatures and technology, even if you do not have access to a computer terminal or other means of research. If the creature or technology was created by a group or individual you are familiar with (normally including any major corporation or military), on a successful check you also identify what group created the object identified.</p>
88	4	Surgeon (Ex; Medicine)	3	<p>You can use Medicine to treat deadly wounds on a patient once each day in addition to the normal allowances for the medical equipment you are using. Because performing this level of advanced medicine is difficult and time consuming, the DC for this additional treatment increases by 5 and the skill check takes 1 hour.</p>
89	4	Tech Familiarity (Ex; Culture)	3	<p>If you forgo rolling your expertise die on a Culture check, you can use Culture to identify hybrid, magic, and technological items as though you were using the Engineering or Mysticism skills.</p>
90	4	Universal Diplomat (Ex; Diplomacy)	3	<p>Your Diplomacy checks to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude are not language-dependent. This allows you to use Diplomacy to change the attitude of a creature with whom you do not share a common language, as well as a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (creatures with no Intelligence score can&rsquo;t have their attitudes improved using the Diplomacy skill unless the GM says otherwise).</p>
91	4	Well Informed (Ex; Diplomacy)	3	<p>You keep yourself as up to date as possible about the events and major figures of any region you are in. Once you have been in a settlement or region for at least 24 hours, when you attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a swift action (rather than the normal 1d4 hours).</p>
92	8	Basic Mods	1	<p>You can choose any of the mods on the basic mod list whenever your drone gains a new mod. Unless otherwise specified, you cannot install a single mod more than once.&nbsp;<a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/class/mechanic/drone/mod#BasicMods">The list of basic mods appears here.</a></p>
93	8	Limited AI (Ex)	1	<p>Each round on your turn, after you have acted, your drone can take either a move action or a standard action to attack (your drone doesn&rsquo;t make a separate initiative roll). You must be able to issue simple commands to your drone, but you don&rsquo;t have to spend actions to issue these commands. To receive these commands, your drone must be able to see or hear you or be within range of your custom rig. If you become unconscious or otherwise unresponsive, or if your drone is ever out of range, your drone cannot take any actions until you are again able to command it or it is once more within range.</p>
94	8	Master Control (Ex)	1	<p>As a move action, you can directly control your drone. This allows the drone to take both a move action and any standard action this turn (one from your control, and one from its limited AI). If you also take a swift action, your drone can take a swift action as well, or it can combine its actions into a full action. Your drone must be able to see or hear you, or be within range of your custom rig, for you to directly control your drone.</p>
95	8	Skill Unit (Ex)	1	<p>Choose one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, Computers, Engineering, Perception, or Stealth. This is a class skill for your drone, and it gains a number of ranks in the chosen skill equal to your class level. Your drone can use this skill when not under your direct control. You can change your drone&rsquo;s skill unit whenever you rebuild your drone from scratch. Additionally, whenever you are directly controlling your drone, it can use any of your skill ranks if you wish, assuming it has the appropriate tools to do so (a drone without manipulator arms cannot use Engineering to disable a device, for example).</p>
96	8	Expert AI (Ex)	7	<p>Your drone&rsquo;s AI has grown more sophisticated, giving it a more robust combat routine when not under your direct control. Each round on your turn, the drone can take a move action, take a standard action to attack, or make a full attack (this last option allows it to shoot more than once if it has the necessary weapons to do so). The drone takes a &ndash;6 penalty to full attacks made without your direct control instead of the normal &ndash;4 penalty. Like limited AI, you must still be conscious and within range.</p>
97	8	Upgraded Power Core (Ex)	10	<p>Your drone gains a pool of Resolve Points equal to 1 per 2 levels it has (minimum 1). Your drone can spend 1 Resolve Point to make a full attack without requiring your direct control and at only the normal &ndash;4 penalty for a full attack instead of the &ndash;6 penalty. Your drone regains Resolve Points after a full 8-hour rest as normal.</p>
98	8	Advanced Mods	11	<p>You can choose from any of the mods on the advanced mod list whenever your drone gains a new mod (in addition to those from the basic mod list). Your drone must always have at least 5 mods from the basic list before you can add any advanced mods, even if you rebuild your drone after it gains this ability.&nbsp;<a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/class/mechanic/drone/mod#AdvancedMods">The list of advanced mods can be found here.</a></p>
99	8	True AI (Ex)	20	<p>Your drone&rsquo;s AI can act with complete autonomy. Each round on your turn, your drone can take a full suite of actions (either a full action or else a move action, a standard action, and a swift action) without requiring your direct control, and it makes full attacks without your direct control with the normal &ndash;4 penalty. You don&rsquo;t need to issue commands to your drone for it to take actions. You must still directly control the drone for it to use your skill ranks.</p>
100	9	Combat Tracking (Ex)	1	<p>Your exocortex provides you with enhanced combat ability, granting you proficiency with heavy armor and longarms. At 3rd level, you gain weapon specialization in longarms just as if your class granted proficiency. As a move action during combat, you can designate a foe for your exocortex to track. As long as that target is in sight, the exocortex feeds you telemetry, vulnerabilities, and combat tactics, allowing you to make attacks against that target as if your base attack bonus from your mechanic levels were equal to your mechanic level. Designating another target causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous target.</p>
101	9	Memory Module (Ex)	1	<p>You can use your exocortex&rsquo;s memory module to enhance your own knowledge. Once per day, as a reaction while not in combat, you can reroll a failed skill check (see page 243) to recall knowledge (see page 143). In addition, your exocortex grants you the Skill Focus feat as a bonus feat. You can&rsquo;t use your exocortex&rsquo;s memory module while combat tracking is activated. Every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your exocortex&rsquo;s memory module, replacing the exocortex&rsquo;s bonus Skill Focus feat with Skill Focus in a different skill.</p>
102	9	Wireless Hack (Ex)	5	<p>Instead of combat tracking, your exocortex can access another computer system within 20 feet, allowing it to attempt a Computers check against that computer each round, using your skill bonus. This counts as a standard action for the purpose of the Computers skill. You must remain within 20 feet of the computer system for the entire time your exocortex is interacting with the computer. If the task requires multiple actions (or even rounds) to accomplish, you can spend your actions to work in concert with your exocortex, counting both your action and the exocortex&rsquo;s effective standard action toward the total time required. If you don&rsquo;t have the remote hack class feature, you must be adjacent to the computer to attempt your checks.</p>
103	9	Exocortex Mods (Ex)	7	<p>Your exocortex allows you to apply any one of the following drone mods to yourself as if you were a drone with that mod installed: armor slot, cargo rack, climbing claws, enhanced senses, hydrojets, jump jets, resistance, smuggler&rsquo;s compartment, speed, or weapon proficiency (gaining proficiency in advanced melee or heavy weapons). At 11th level, you can apply an additional mod, and your options expand to include echolocators, excavator, flight system, greater resistance, invisibility field, and reactive camouflage. At 14th and 17th levels, you can apply an additional mod. Each time you gain a level, you can switch any of your mods for different mods, but you must always choose at least one mod from the 7th-level list.</p>
104	9	Twin Tracking (Ex)	10	<p>You can designate two targets for your exocortex to track, increasing your base attack bonus against each. You can designate both targets with a single move action, but you must be able to see them both at that time.</p>
105	9	Multitasking (Ex)	15	<p>You can designate three targets for your exocortex to track (and designate them all as a single move action). In addition, the range of your exocortex&rsquo;s wireless hack increases to 40 feet. Your exocortex can also engage in combat tracking and hack a nearby computer at the same time, but the computer counts as one of the exocortex&rsquo;s designated targets (allowing you to track only two targets at the same time while wirelessly hacking the computer). Lastly, you can access your exocortex&rsquo;s memory module in combat, even while it is engaged in combat tracking.</p>
106	9	Quad Tracking (Ex)	20	<p>Your exocortex can track four targets simultaneously, and hacking a nearby computer doesn&rsquo;t count against that limit.</p>
107	12	Attentive Tampering (Ex)	2	<p>You have a soft touch and naturally conceal signs of your tampering. Do not increase the DC of Engineering checks to hide your attempts to disable a device.</p>
108	12	Combat Maintenance (Ex)	2	<p>As a move action, you can fortify an item you touch against attack. The item&rsquo;s hardness increases by an amount equal to your mechanic level (to a maximum of double its normal hardness) for 1 round. If the item is one you are wearing or holding, you can use this ability as a purely defensive reaction to an attack against it.</p>
109	12	Concealed Device (Ex)	2	<p>In a process that requires an hour of uninterrupted work, you can hide a non-consumable piece of technological gear inside a larger technological object (something of higher bulk). For instance, you can conceal a personal comm unit inside a pair of hoverskates (Starfinder Armory 104) or a detonator inside a basic medkit. The concealed item easily passes casual inspection, but someone using a scanner or performing a close inspection can discover it with a successful Perception check (DC = 10 + your total Engineering skill modifier &ndash; the concealed item&rsquo;s bulk [minimum 1]). Both devices retain their normal functionality and require their own batteries, but if the concealed device requires a skill check to use, the user takes a &ndash;2 penalty to that skill check. You can&rsquo;t conceal weapons or armor or conceal items in weapons or armor.<br />Starting at 5th level, you can conceal the functional parts of a technological item or a ranged weapon inside a technological object of the same size, as long as that object is at least 1 bulk. For instance, you can conceal an azimuth laser pistol inside a large-enough musical instrument (Armory 105) or a pulsecaster pistol inside a beacon. Concealing a weapon in this way imposes a &ndash;2 penalty to attack rolls with that weapon and reduces its range by half. This requires an additional hour of work and an amount of UPBs equal to 10% of the concealed item.<br />In either case, do not combine the bulk of the two devices; only the higher bulk counts toward a character&rsquo;s bulk limit.</p>
110	12	Distracting Hack (Ex)	2	<p>You can hack a computer within 30 feet of a foe to distract that foe, such as with a sudden noise or an image. You must be able to access the computer (whether it is your own computer or you are within range to access one manually or via remote hack). This functions as a feint action except that it uses your Computers skill instead of Bluff, so you can apply the benefits of Improved Feint and Greater Feint if you have them.</p>
111	12	Energy Shield (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to activate an energy shield around yourself. This shield provides you with a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your mechanic level. The shield remains active for 1 minute per mechanic level or until all of its temporary Hit Points are depleted, whichever comes first. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest; your shield automatically shuts off during this period of rest.</p>
112	12	Hack Directory (Ex)	2	<p>Whenever you attempt to hack a system and fail the check, you immediately become aware of any countermeasures that were activated due to your failure. You can then select one of these countermeasures and attempt another Computers check (with the same DC as the original). If you succeed at this second check, you can prevent that countermeasure from activating, as if you had not attempted to access the system at all. Any other countermeasures have their normal effect.</p>
113	12	Implant Ghost (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can attempt to hack into the cybernetics installed in a creature you can see within 60 feet with a Computers check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the target&rsquo;s CR). If you succeed, choose one of the target&rsquo;s cybernetic implants; your exocortex forms a secret wireless link to that augmentation, allowing you to record what it experiences. You can see what a cybernetic eye sees, hear what a cybernetic ear hears, copy the data a datajack downloads, or track the movement of a cybernetic hand (potentially learning combinations or keystrokes). You can maintain this link until your target moves more than 500 feet from you, you fall unconscious or asleep, or you choose to end it (this takes no action). You must have an exocortex to learn this trick.</p>
114	12	Natural Computer	2	<p>With 1 minute of work, you can use your custom rig to create a basic computer interface on a natural unworked surface, such as on the ground, a tree, or a rock face. The interface requires a power source and uses 1 charge per hour. If you are a plant creature, this instead takes a standard action and does not require a power source. The interface is attuned to unmodified material of the type on which it is placed. You know the general direction and distance of attuned materials, and you can use the interface to surveil its surroundings at distance of up to 50 feet &times; your mechanic level. The surveillance square has ordinary vision but can see only out to 30 feet.</p>
115	12	Neural Shunt (Ex)	2	<p>Once per day, as a reaction when you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you can shunt that effect into your exocortex instead. When you do so, you are not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, you lose the Skill Focus feat granted by your exocortex&rsquo;s memory module and cannot use any of the exocortex&rsquo;s abilities in any way (including any proficiencies and mods it grants you). When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the exocortex, spells such as dispel magic or break enchantment can be cast on you to end the effect as if you were affected by it. Once the duration of the mindaffecting effect has ended, your exocortex resumes its normal functions. You must have an exocortex to learn this trick.</p>
116	12	Nightvision Processor (Ex)	2	<p>Your visual data processor allows you to see better in conditions of poor lighting, granting you low-light vision and darkvision to a range of 60 feet. You must have the visual data processor mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
117	12	Overcharge (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to overcharge and attack with a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered special property (see page 181) that you&rsquo;re holding. If you hit, you deal 1d6 additional damage of the same type the weapon normally deals. This attack uses three times as many charges from the battery or power cell as normal and can&rsquo;t be used if the weapon doesn&rsquo;t have enough charges. This trick has no effect on a weapon without a battery or power cell. You can instead use this ability as a move action on a touched powered weapon that is unattended or attended by an ally to grant the same effect to that weapon&rsquo;s next attack before the beginning of your next turn.</p>
118	12	Overclocking (Ex)	2	<p>You have augmented the performance of your AI for maximum response timing. You gain a +2 insight bonus to initiative checks, and either you (if you have an exocortex) or your drone (if you have a drone) gains a +2 insight bonus to Reflex saves.</p>
119	12	Overload Weapon (Ex)	2	<p>As a full action or as a move action by spending 1 Resolve Point, you can cause a powered weapon (either a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered special property) in your possession to explode. You can use the weapon as if it were a grenade of the weapon&rsquo;s item level or lower dealing the weapon&rsquo;s normal damage type, except the weapon has a range increment of only 10 feet unless it is a thrown weapon. If someone tries to attack with the weapon, it explodes as a grenade would instead, centered on the user, and the user doesn&rsquo;t receive a Reflex save to negate the grenade&rsquo;s effect (if any). Once you&rsquo;ve primed a weapon to explode in this way, it&rsquo;s difficult to reverse the effect, requiring 8 hours of work and a successful Engineering check (DC = 15 + your Engineering bonus); failing the check by 5 or more detonates the weapon. Once detonated, the weapon is destroyed, just like a grenade.</p>
120	12	Portable Charging Station (Ex)	2	<p>You can use your custom rig to recharge batteries. You can spend 10 minutes in contact with a battery and restore its charges to full. Once you have used your portable charging station a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum 1), you can&rsquo;t do so again for 24 hours.</p>
121	12	Portable Power (Ex)	2	<p>You can use your custom rig to supply limited power for up to 1 minute to a computer or starship system that lacks power. If this system is part of a much larger network, this trick does not supply power to the entire network, just to a limited point of access (typically a terminal), which might greatly limit functionality. Once you have used portable power on a system, you cannot do so again on that system for 24 hours.</p>
122	12	Protective Programming (Ex)	2	<p>Once per day as a reaction when you fail a Reflex saving throw against an attack or spell that deals damage, if your drone is within 10 feet of the line between you and the damaging effect, you can direct your drone to interpose itself between you and the source of that damage. Your drone takes the damage the attack would have dealt to you, and you take no damage. If your drone is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed until you repair it or build a new drone. You must have the drone option of the artificial intelligence class feature to choose this trick.</p>
123	12	Provisional Repair (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can temporarily patch up a broken weapon or technological item to suppress the penalties from the broken condition for 1 minute per mechanic level. This does not restore any Hit Points to the item, and it does not function on an item reduced to 0 Hit Points.<br />Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat, once per combat you can perform the hold it together action in the same round you perform another engineering action.</p>
124	12	Quick Patch (Ex)	2	<p>When you attempt to patch a system on a starship, you reduce the number of actions required to do so by one. This does not reduce the time needed to patch a glitching system, but you can patch two systems with one action.</p>
125	12	Quick Repair (Ex)	2	<p>When you attempt to repair an item, you can do so in half the time normally required (to a minimum of a full action).</p>
126	12	Recalibrate Engine (Ex)	2	<p>As a full action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a touched vehicle&rsquo;s engine with your custom rig to get a little more or less power out of it for 1 minute per mechanic level or until you undo it as a full action. The vehicle gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to its speed and a +50 feet (+5 mph) enhancement bonus to its full speed (to a maximum of double) and its Piloting modifier is reduced by 2. You can also penalize its speed to increase its piloting modifier.<br />Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat you use the recalibrate engine ability in place of any other engineering action. The ship gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its speed for 1 turn, and the Piloting check made in the Helm phase to determine the order of movement of starships gains a +2 enhancement bonus, but all other Piloting checks made that turn take a &ndash;5 penalty.</p>
127	12	Repair Drone (Ex)	2	<p>When you spend 10 minutes to repair your drone, you repair 25% of its maximum Hit Points instead of 10%. You must have a drone to learn this trick.</p>
128	12	Tech Tinkerer (Ex)	2	<p>You know how to modify the functions of UPBs to radically alter how items work. With 10 minutes of work, you can modify a technological item so that it temporarily functions as any other lower-level technological item of the same or lower bulk (losing its original function while in this new form). The item must have an item level and bulk no greater than half your mechanic level. If the new item requires a battery that has more charges than the original device&rsquo;s battery (or another source of power or fuel not present in the original item), you must also provide the appropriate battery or power source. Any charges or similar expenditure from the new item come from the original item (if possible) or the new power source you install (if one was required). The new item retains the original item&rsquo;s bulk. Any damage dealt to the new item is retained when it returns to its original form. If the item is broken or destroyed in its modified form, it remains broken or destroyed when it returns to its original form and must be repaired or replaced normally.<br />This change lasts for 10 minutes per mechanic level or until you undo it with 10 minutes of work. You cannot modify or produce armor, augmentations, hybrid or magic items, items with limited uses or charges (such as batteries, drugs, or fuel), or weapons, although you can produce an item that uses charges from a battery or fuel if there is a separate battery or power source to power it. At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability to modify an item whose level is equal to your mechanic level, giving it the function of a lower-level item.</p>
129	12	Technological Medic (Ex)	2	<p>You can use your knowledge of machines and technology to repair androids and robots. Whenever you attempt a Medicine check to assist an android, SRO, or other creature with the constructed racial trait or construct (technological) subtype, you can use your Engineering skill instead of Medicine to achieve the same results (Starfinder Core Rulebook 143). Your custom rig acts as a medkit for this purpose (or an advanced medkit, if you are 5th level or higher).</p>
130	12	Visual Data Processor (Ex)	2	<p>You notice even the smallest shifts in movement, temperature, and vibration, gaining the insight bonus from your bypass class feature to Perception skill checks.</p>
131	12	Bolster Armor (Ex)	8	<p>As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to modify a touched suit of light armor, heavy armor, or powered armor, granting it a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your mechanic level. Any damage to the armor or its wearer is subtracted from these temporary Hit Points first. These temporary Hit Points last 1 minute or until reduced to 0. Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t do so again unless you expend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.<br />Additionally, when acting in the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single quadrant of your starship. You bolster that section of the ship&rsquo;s armor or defensive countermeasures, increasing the ship&rsquo;s Armor Class or Target Lock (respectively) in that quadrant by 2 for a number of rounds equal to your mechanic level; alternatively, you can restore a number of Shield Points in that quadrant equal to your mechanic level.</p>
132	12	Boost Shield (Ex)	8	<p>Your energy shield grants you a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier + double your mechanic level. In addition, if you have already used your shield, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use it again without having to regain Stamina Points first. This replenishes your shield&rsquo;s temporary Hit Points to full. You must have the energy shield mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
133	12	Drone Meld (Ex)	8	<p>As a full action while in contact with your drone, you can reconfigure it into a mechanical drone suit (or a backpack-like apparatus, for the Tiny hover drone) that you can wear. While in this form, the drone can&rsquo;t take any actions or use any of its abilities, but you gain either the drone&rsquo;s flight system mods if you have a hover drone, reactive camouflage (and an invisibility field if your drone has it) if you have a stealth drone, or reductive plating if you have a combat drone. You can end the meld and return the drone to its normal form as a full action. Though it normally acts on your turn just after you, the drone can take no actions on that turn other than transforming back.</p>
134	12	Engineer’s Eye (Ex)	8	<p>When you are within 10 feet of a trapped or malfunctioning machine or computer, you receive a free Computers, Engineering, or Perception check (as decided by the GM) to notice the trap or defect, whether or not you are actively looking. In addition, due to your intimate knowledge of your ship, you receive one of these checks whenever you board your ship to notice if anything is wrong with the ship&rsquo;s systems.</p>
135	12	Ghost Intrusion (Ex)	8	<p>Whenever you use the Computers skill to access a system and you fail to overcome its defenses by 4 or less, you do not trigger any countermeasures and there is no log of your attempt. If you fail by 5 or more, any countermeasures take effect against you as normal.</p>
136	12	Holographic Projector (Ex)	8	<p>Your custom rig can project holographic images as a standard action as often as you like, as per 2nd-level holographic image except it can create speech and has a range of only 120 feet.</p>
137	12	Hyperclocking (Ex)	8	<p>You further improve the response time of your AI. If you have a drone, your drone gains a +1 insight bonus to AC. In addition, if your drone is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw. If you have an exocortex, you gain a +1 insight bonus to AC. In addition, whenever you fail a Reflex saving throw, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll the saving throw (see page 243) and take the higher result. You must have the overclocking mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
138	12	Implant Glitch (Ex)	8	<p>When you successfully hack into a creature&rsquo;s cybernetics using implant ghost, you can instead choose for your exocortex to broadcast garbage signals to the chosen implant, inflicting deleterious effects, depending on the system in which the implant is installed. If the implant is installed in an arm, hand, or brain, the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to attack rolls. If the implant is installed in the ears or eyes, the target takes a &ndash;4 penalty to Perception checks. If the implant is installed in a foot or leg, the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Reflex saves, and if the implant is installed in any other system, the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Fortitude saves. A different penalty can be imparted at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. Once established, this link lasts 1 round for every mechanic level you has, unless the target moves more than 100 feet from you, you fall unconscious, or you choose to end it (this takes no action). You must have an exocortex and the implant ghost mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
139	12	Improved Overcharge (Ex)	8	<p>The additional damage of the overcharge mechanic trick increases to 2d6. You must have the overcharge mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
140	12	Invisibility Bypass Processor (Ex)	8	<p>Your visual data processor now allows you to see invisible creatures as per see invisibility. You must have the visual data processor mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
141	12	Mobile Armory (Ex)	8	<p>You can modify a weapon or armor upgrade (either of which must not be archaic or analog) with the tech tinkerer mechanic trick. You can turn a weapon into another weapon or an armor upgrade into another armor upgrade, or turn either a weapon or an armor upgrade into a technological item. If you turn a weapon into another weapon that uses a different type of ammunition, you must provide that ammunition separately. You must have the tech tinkerer mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
142	12	Recalibrate Weapon (Ex)	8	<p>As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to modify a touched ranged small arm, longarm, or heavy weapon. You can increase its range increment by 20 feet (or double, whichever is less), but doing so reduces the weapon&rsquo;s damage dice by 1 when wielded by anyone other than you (for example, a weapon that would normally deal 3d8 damage deals 2d8 damage instead; a weapon reduced to 0 dice does 1 damage) or reduce its save DC by 2 for weapons that don&rsquo;t use damage dice. You can instead reduce the range increment of such a weapon with a range increment of at least 40 feet to one-quarter its normal range and either increase its damage by 1d6 of its usual type or increase its save DC by 1 (for weapons that do not use damage dice). The item must be unattended or held by a willing creature. This change lasts for 1 minute per mechanic level or until you reverse the effect with a move action.<br />Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single non-capital weapon. You either extend or shorten the weapon&rsquo;s range by one step; doing so reduces its damage dice by 1 (such as 4d4 to 3d4, with weapons reduced to 0 dice doing 1 damage) or increases its damage by 1d6, respectively. You can&rsquo;t reduce a weapon&rsquo;s range below short or extend it beyond long. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level or until you undo the recalibration as a push engineer action.</p>
143	12	Resistant Energy (Ex)	8	<p>Even when your energy shield is inactive, the ambient energy protects you from a particular type of energy attack. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type. You must have the energy shield mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
144	12	Scoutbot (Ex)	8	<p>You&rsquo;re always crafting rudimentary bots in your spare time, and can use them to scout. It takes you 10 minutes and 1 Resolve Point to create a scoutbot. A scoutbot is a Small technological construct, its EAC and KAC are equal to 10 + your mechanic level, and it has 1 Hit Point per mechanic level you have (and no Stamina Points). It has a land speed of 30 feet, and you can control its movements with your custom rig as a move action. It has a camera that streams visual and auditory data back to your rig. The scoutbot uses your saving throw bonuses if necessary. It is untrained in all skills and has a +0 bonus in all of them, though you can use your own Perception skill when examining the feed from its stream. Once created, the scoutbot lasts for 1 minute per mechanic level you have before falling apart unless otherwise destroyed.</p>
145	12	Shocking Overload (Ex)	8	<p>You can use your overload or override class feature to damage a creature. When you successfully use overload to cause a short in an electronic device in someone&rsquo;s possession and the item&rsquo;s owner fails their Reflex saving throw, that creature takes electricity damage as a result of the power surge. This surge deals 1d6 electricity damage per 4 levels of mechanic you have. When you use your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or other creature with the technological subtype, that creature takes 1d6 electrical damage per 2 levels of mechanic you have and can attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to negate this damage.</p>
146	12	Technological Innovator (Ex)	8	<p>Choose two mechanic tricks you meet the prerequisites for but don&rsquo;t have. Once per day as a move action, you can gain one of these tricks for 10 minutes. Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can replace one of these mechanic tricks with another that you meet the prerequisites for but don&rsquo;t have.</p>
147	12	Extra Mod (Ex)	14	<p>If you have a drone, your drone gains an additional basic mod. If you have an exocortex, you gain an additional basic mod. It can&rsquo;t be a basic mod taken a second time as an advanced mod. You can rebuild this extra mod when you gain a mechanic level as with any other mod, but you can&rsquo;t rebuild this mod to convert it into the advanced version of the mod.</p>
148	12	Improved Resistant Energy (Ex)	14	<p>Choose an additional energy type from resistant energy. You gain resistance 15 against both this and your original energy type. You must have the energy shield and resistant energy mechanic tricks to learn this trick.</p>
149	12	Inventive Engineer (Ex)	14	<p>You are adept at recalibrating and enhancing a starship&rsquo;s systems. When acting in the engineer or chief mate (see pages 146&ndash;148) roles during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily boost your starship&rsquo;s capabilities. Choose one of the following options. Any change lasts for 1 turn of starship combat per mechanic level. A ship can benefit from only one of these options at a time; if it gains another of these benefits from any source, any previous inventive engineer benefit ends.<br /><strong>Amplify Shields:</strong>&nbsp;You double the regeneration speed of your ship&rsquo;s shields.<br /><strong>Angle Shields:</strong>&nbsp;Select one weapon arc of your starship. Any attack made against you from a starship in that arc takes a &ndash;1 penalty to the attack roll.<br /><strong>Countermeasures:</strong>&nbsp;Your starship&rsquo;s TL increased by 1.<br /><strong>Low Power Mode:</strong>&nbsp;You reduce the PCU cost of a specific system by 10 (minimum 5 PCU).<br /><strong>Speed Boost:</strong>&nbsp;You increase your ship&rsquo;s speed by 2 hexes.</p>
150	12	Invisibility-Hampering Projector (Ex)	14	<p>As a move action, you can use your custom rig&rsquo;s holographic projector to project a holographic image in a direct overlay over an invisible creature within 120 feet, and your custom rig&rsquo;s computer moves the image to follow the invisible creature, effectively negating the creature&rsquo;s invisibility as long as it remains within 120 feet of you. If it moves beyond that range, it breaks the effect until you use this ability again. You must have the holographic projector, invisibility bypass processor, and visual data processor mechanic tricks to learn this trick.</p>
151	12	Melded Mod (Ex)	14	<p>When you use your drone meld trick, your drone retains access to one of its basic mods. If the mod grants the drone abilities, attacks, or senses, you can use that ability, attack, or sense. If the mod lets the drone take an action without you commanding it to (such as the medical subroutine mod), the drone can end the drone meld and perform that action if the circumstances that would normally cause it to do so are fulfilled. If the mod requires equipment or tools that are not granted as part of the mod, you must have the appropriate equipment or tolls, separate from your drone, to use the mod. You can&rsquo;t choose a mod that requires another mod. You must have the drone meld mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
152	12	Mod Tinkerer (Ex)	14	<p>You can spend 24 hours of uninterrupted work to exchange all your drone or exocortex mods at any time, even if you haven&rsquo;t gained a level. Any other drone features (such as its chassis or bonus feats) can still be exchanged only when you gain a level.</p>
153	12	Prototype Tinkerer (Ex)	14	<p>You can spend 8 hours of uninterrupted work to rebuild your experimental prototype at any time, even if you haven&rsquo;t gained a level. You may do this even if it is broken or destroyed, and can even rebuild it from scratch if you have appropriate spare parts or scrap. This allows you to exchange any customizations you have selected. You must have an experimental prototype to learn this trick.</p>
154	12	Saboteur (Ex)	14	<p>Whenever you use the Engineering skill to sabotage or disable a device, you can roll twice and take the better result. In addition, if you have the appropriate tools (including your custom rig), performing these tasks takes half the normal amount of time, to a minimum of 1 move action.</p>
155	12	Scoutbod Mod (Ex)	14	<p>Whenever you create a scoutbot, you can give it one basic drone mod. You must have the scoutbot mechanic trick to learn this trick.</p>
156	12	Superior Overcharge (Ex)	14	<p>The additional damage of the overcharge mechanic trick increases to 4d6. You must have the overcharge and improved overcharge mechanic tricks to learn this trick. You can select this trick multiple times. Each time you do after the first, increase the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 7d6 if you select it all four times).</p>
157	12	Superior Science Officer (Ex)	14	<p>You excel at operating starship computer systems, and you can exploit your ship&rsquo;s programming in ways others can&rsquo;t. When acting in the science officer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily enhance your starship&rsquo;s computer. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level. A ship can benefit from only one of these options at a time; if it gains another of these benefits from any source, any previous superior science officer option ends.<br /><strong>Improved Sensors:</strong>&nbsp;Your scan actions reveal an additional piece of information about the starship being scanned. For instance, if your Computers skill check to scan a starship succeeds by 5 or more, you learn two pieces of information instead of one.<br /><strong>Targeted Sensors:</strong>&nbsp;When you perform a scan action, you can choose which information category to learn information about, regardless of the normal order of information you would learn (Starfinder Core Rulebook 325).<br /><strong>Upgrade Node:</strong>&nbsp;You divert additional power to your starship&rsquo;s computer, granting the computer&rsquo;s bonus to one additional starship combat check per round.</p>
158	12	Ultraclocking (Ex)	14	<p>If you have a drone, you can grant the effects of haste to your drone for 1 minute as a move action. If you have an exocortex, you can gain the effects of haste for 1 minute as a move action. Once you or your drone has used this ability, you cannot use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points from a 10-minute rest. You must have the overclocking and hyperclocking mechanic tricks to learn this trick.</p>
159	26	Akashic	1	<p>You&rsquo;re linked to the collective knowledge of every sentient species that ever lived that&rsquo;s held in the Akashic Record, an Astral library of perfect psychic records of every moment in history.

172	37	Daredevil	1	<p>You specialize in missions requiring courage and athleticism.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Acrobatics and Athletics. You can attempt an Acrobatics check to make a trick attack.<br /><strong>5th Level&nbsp;Specialization Exploit:</strong>&nbsp;Versatile movement.<br /><strong>11th Level&nbsp;Terrain Attack (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;At 11th level, when you and a foe are both balancing, climbing, flying, or swimming, you automatically succeed at any Bluff check required to make a trick attack against that foe.</p>
173	37	Detective	1	<p>Your ability to read people and make deductions helps you ferret out the truth in any situation.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Culture and Sense Motive. You can attempt a Sense Motive check with a +4 bonus to make a trick attack by reading your foe.<br /><strong>5th Level&nbsp;Specialization Exploit:</strong>&nbsp;Glimpse the truth.<br /><strong>11th Level&nbsp;Detective&rsquo;s Insight (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;At 11th level, your incredible insights help you move investigations forward where mundane inquiries fail. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point and take 10 minutes pondering a mystery or quandary to gain an enigmatic insight as if you had cast divination (though the result is often presented as a cryptic clue).</p>
174	37	Explorer	1	<p>You&rsquo;re an expert in scouting out dangerous locations using your knowledge and survival skills.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Culture and Survival. You can attempt a Survival check with a +4 bonus to make a trick attack by using your surroundings to your advantage.<br /><strong>5th Level&nbsp;Specialization Exploit:</strong>&nbsp;Ever vigilant.<br /><strong>11th Level&nbsp;Into the Unknown (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;At 11th level, you gain a +4 bonus to Culture and Survival checks. While you&rsquo;re outside both the Pact Worlds and your home star system (if different), you gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, in games centered around a different star system than the Pact Worlds, replace the Pact Worlds with that star system.</p>
175	37	Gadgeteer	1	<p>You rely on your quick wits and a healthy dose of paranoia to always have the right device at hand.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Engineering and Sleight of Hand.

176	37	Ghost	1	<p>You can move from place to place without being noticed.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Acrobatics and Stealth. When you use Stealth to make a trick attack, you gain a&nbsp;<del>+4</del>&nbsp;<ins>+1</ins>&nbsp;bonus to the skill check.<br /><br /><a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1hi#v5748eaic9wbp">Updated Feb 2018</a><br /><strong>5th Level&nbsp;Specialization Exploit:</strong>&nbsp;Cloaking field.<br /><strong>11th Level&nbsp;Phase Shift Escape (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;At 11th level, you can move through solid matter by taking your body&rsquo;s matter out of phase for just a moment. As a full action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to phase through up to 5 feet of solid matter. If you attempt to phase through something that is too thick, you spend the Resolve Point and take the action but the attempt fails. You cannot phase through force effects such as force fields or the barrier created by wall of force. After using phase shift escape, you can&rsquo;t use it again until after you&rsquo;ve taken a full 8-hour rest.</p>
177	37	Hacker	1	<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a computer system or a mechanical device, you can hack it.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Computers and Engineering. You can attempt a Computers check with a +4 bonus to make a trick attack by creating a computerized distraction (you can&rsquo;t use this option if stripped of all computerized gear in an area with no computers).<br /><strong>5th Level&nbsp;Specialization Exploit:</strong>&nbsp;Elusive hacker.<br /><strong>11th Level&nbsp;Control Hack (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;At 11th level, when you exceed the DC of a Computers or Engineering check to disable a device or computer system by 5 or more, you can instead take control of the device or system. For every 5 by which you exceed the DC, you can typically make the device or system perform one task, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. Once the device or system has done what you commanded, you choose whether the device deactivates or returns to normal.</p>
178	37	Spy	1	<p>You can steal or adopt new identities as easily as most people change clothes, allowing you to infiltrate nearly any circle.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Bluff and Disguise. When you use Bluff to make a trick attack, you gain a +4 bonus to the skill check.<br /><strong>5th Level&nbsp;Specialization Exploit:</strong>&nbsp;Master of disguise.<br /><strong>11th Level&nbsp;Fool Detection (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;At 11th level, whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell, technological device, or ability that would provide information about you (such as detect thoughts), instead of negating the effect, you can provide false information that matches your cover identity. If such an effect has no saving throw, you can attempt a Bluff check opposed by the Sense Motive check of the caster or user, and provide similar false information on a success.</p>
179	37	Thief	1	<p>You specialize in acquisition, from quick swipes to complex heists.</p><p><strong>1st Level&nbsp;Associated Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Perception and Sleight of Hand. You can use Sleight of Hand to make a trick attack by concealing your weapons and motions.<br /><strong>5th Level&nbsp;Specialization Exploit:</strong>&nbsp;Holographic distraction.<br /><strong>11th Level&nbsp;Contingency Plan (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;At 11th level, you&rsquo;ve performed enough heists to realize that things never go exactly as you had planned. When something unexpected happens during a heist or infiltration, you can spend 2 Resolve Points and specify a contingency plan that you had set up in advance for this eventuality, either having the right prop (such as an ID or a computer file, but not a particularly valuable item), having the right information, or having hired a confederate to perform a single task at the right time. You then attempt a skill check. The appropriate skill and the DC are at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, with a higher DC for a more elaborate or unlikely contingency (see Skill DCs on page 392 for more information on setting skill DCs). If you succeed, you have the item or knowledge, or the confederate performs the task as specified. If you fail, either you don&rsquo;t have what you need or your plan fails.</p>
180	43	Alien Archive (Ex)	2	<p>Your vast experience makes identifying new creatures easier for you. Double your operative&rsquo;s edge bonus to your skill checks when identifying a creature and its abilities. If you successfully identify a creature, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your skill check when you make a trick attack against that creature.</p>
181	43	Armor Optimizer (Ex)	2	<p>You&rsquo;ve learned to customize your armor. You can adjust armor (Core Rulebook 196) to fit you without needing to attempt an Engineering check. This also allows you to add one upgrade slot to the armor, though any upgrade that uses that slot functions only when you wear the armor. Such upgrades are useless to anyone else.</p>
182	43	Combat Trick (Ex)	2	<p>You gain a bonus combat feat. You must meet all of that feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.</p>
183	43	Concealed Weaponry (Ex)	2	<p>You are adept at concealing your weapons and other items. Double your operative&rsquo;s edge bonus to Sleight of Hand checks when attempting to hide a small object on your body. Additionally, you can draw a hidden weapon as quickly as a non-hidden weapon.</p>
184	43	Death Strike (Ex)	2	<p>As part of any attack you make, you can add the operative weapon special feature to your unarmed attacks. When you do this, it loses the archaic weapon special feature. When you do this, if you would normally add 1-1/2 times your character level to damage as a special form of specialization (such as from a racial trait such as a vesk&rsquo;s natural weapons), you instead add only your character level to damage. This is true regardless of how many abilities or effects you have modifying your specialization that apply to your unarmed attacks.</p>
185	43	Elite Saboteur (Ex)	2	<p>You can attempt an Engineering check to disable a device on a lock or trap in half the normal time. If this would reduce the duration to less than 1 round, you can disable the device as a standard action.</p>
186	43	Feign Death (Ex)	2	<p>Whenever you take damage, you can attempt to feign death as a reaction. You immediately fall prone and attempt a Bluff check against each opponent that is aware of you. The DC for this check is equal to 10 + your opponent&rsquo;s total Sense Motive skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the opponent&rsquo;s CR, whichever is greater. Any opponent that you succeed against believes that you are dead and acts accordingly unless it inspects your body as a standard action and succeeds at a Medicine, Perception, or Sense Motive check at the same DC to uncover your deception. Maintaining this ruse is a full action each turn.</p>
187	43	Field Treatment (Ex)	2	<p>You can take 1 minute to tend your wounds and spend 1 Resolve Point to recover a number of Hit Points equal to three times your operative level.</p>
188	43	Holographic Clone (Ex)	2	<p>You can create holographic duplicates or psychic projections of yourself that conceal your true location. Once per day as a standard action, you can create 1d4 images of yourself that last for 1 minute per operative level. This ability otherwise functions as mirror image. You can use this exploit an additional time per day at 6th level, and again at 10th level.</p>
189	43	Inoculation (Ex)	2	<p>You&rsquo;ve trained to resist various chemical and biological weapons, toxins, and pathogens you come across in the course of your missions. You add your operative&rsquo;s edge bonus to Fortitude saves against poison and disease.</p>
190	43	Jack of All Trades (Ex)	2	<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to handle any situation. You can use all skills untrained, and you double your operative&rsquo;s edge bonus when using a skill in which you have no ranks.</p>
191	43	Kick It Up (Ex)	2	<p>As a move action, or at the beginning of any action you take that allows you to move (even if you do not choose to use that action to move), you may attempt to kick an unattended, unsecured object of no more than 2 bulk that is on the ground in your square or an adjacent square up into your hands. You must attempt a DC 15 Acrobatics check, and on a success you are holding the object in one or more of your free hands. If you hold it with enough hands to allow you to wield it, you can choose to be wielding it.</p>
192	43	Lightning Reload (Ex)	2	<p>You treat all small arms that do not have the automatic weapon special property as having the quick reload weapon special property.</p>
193	43	Nightvision (Ex)	2	<p>You can see in the dark as if you had low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
194	43	Pistol Whip (Ex)	2	<p>You can use a small arm to make a melee attack. Treat this as an attack using Improved Unarmed Strike (whether or not you have that feat), but the attack is not archaic, deals lethal damage, and has the operative weapon special property. If you have an ability that gives you a special version of Weapon Specialization that allows you to add 1-1/2 &times; your level to natural or unarmed attacks as damage (such as vesk natural weapons), you add your level to pistol whip unarmed strikes; otherwise you add half your level as normal for an operative weapon. When you make an unarmed attack, you must decide before making the attack roll whether you are making a normal unarmed attack or using pistol whip to attack with a small arm.</p>
195	43	Quick Disguise (Ex)	2	<p>Once per day as a standard action, you can quickly change your appearance. This functions as disguise self and lasts for 1 minute per operative level. You can use this exploit an additional time per day at 6th level, and again at 10th level.</p>
196	43	Shuriken Assassin (Ex)	2	<p>You gain the Special Weapon Proficiency feat with carbonedge shuriken (and no other model of shuriken) as a bonus feat. Additionally, you can add your Dexterity modifier rather than your Strength modifier to ranged attack rolls with carbonedge shuriken, and you make melee attack rolls with carbonedge shuriken as if they were basic melee operative weapons. You can use the trick attack class feature with a carbonedge shuriken. At 3rd level, you gain the Weapon Specialization feat with carbonedge shuriken (and no other model of shuriken) as a bonus feat. At 12th level, you deal an additional 1d4 damage with carbonedge shuriken and treat them as having the injection weapon special property. At 17th level, the additional damage dealt with carbonedge shuriken increases from 1d4 to 2d4.</p>
197	43	Trap Spotter (Ex)	2	<p>You double your operative&rsquo;s edge bonus to Perception checks to notice traps. Additionally, you automatically receive a Perception check to notice a trap when you pass within 10 feet of it.</p>
198	43	Uncanny Mobility (Ex)	2	<p>When you make a trick attack, if you choose the target of your attack before you move, your movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity from that target. When you use your standard action to move, you can choose one creature; you don&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature for this movement.</p>
199	43	Uncanny Pilot (Ex)	2	<p>When you attack while you&rsquo;re driving a vehicle, you halve the vehicle&rsquo;s penalty to your attack roll (to a minimum of no penalty if the vehicle normally imposes a &ndash;1 penalty). When you&rsquo;re in a chase, you gain a +2 bonus to skill checks you attempt when taking the evade or trick pilot actions.</p>
200	43	Without A Trace (Ex)	2	<p>When you attempt a skill check opposed by a foe&rsquo;s Perception check, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your skill check&rsquo;s result. In addition, the DC to follow your tracks with the Survival skill increases by 4.</p>
201	43	Bleeding Shot (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can afflict your target with an amount of bleed damage equal to your operative level.</p>
202	43	Certainty (Ex)	6	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to reroll one of your specialization&rsquo;s associated skill checks (see page 243).</p>
203	43	Debilitating Sniper (Ex)	6	<p>You can use trick attack with sniper weapons. You do not add trick attack damage to your attack, but the target is still flatfooted, and you can use debilitating tricks.</p>
204	43	Disarming Attack (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to disarm the target. Choose an item the target is holding that would be subject to a standard disarm combat maneuver. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or drop that item. If the target gains a bonus to its KAC against disarm combat maneuvers it adds this bonus to its saving throw, and if it is immune to the disarm combat maneuver it is immune to this operative exploit. Once you have used this ability to attempt to disarm a creature, that creature is immune to your disarming attack for 24 hours.</p>
205	43	Disrupting Shot (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to hinder your opponent&rsquo;s ability to cast spells and spell-like abilities. The target must succeed at a Will save or be unable to cast spells or spell-like abilities for 1 round. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to attempt to hinder an opponent&rsquo;s spellcasting, that creature is immune to your disrupting shot for 24 hours. You must have the deactivating shot and staggering shot exploits to choose this exploit.</p>
206	43	Enhanced Senses (Ex)	6	<p>You can sense your surroundings without needing to see them. You gain blindsense with a range of 60 feet. You must have darkvision and low-light vision, or the nightvision exploit, to learn this exploit.</p>
207	43	Fast Aim (Ex)	6	<p>As long as you are not flat-footed, off-kilter, or off-target, when attacking with a sniper rifle you use the range increment value listed with the sniper special property.</p>
208	43	Hampering Shot (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can reduce your target&rsquo;s speeds by half and prevent it from using the guarded step action until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
209	43	Improved Quick Movement (Ex)	6	<p>You can move even faster than other operatives. You gain double the benefits of your quick movement ability, up to a maximum additional increase of +20 feet. You must have quick movement to learn this exploit.</p>
210	43	Interfering Shot (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can prevent your target from using reactions (see page 244) until the end of your next turn.</p>
211	43	Knee Shot (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to knock the target prone. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. If the target gains a bonus to its KAC against trip combat maneuvers, it adds this bonus to its saving throw, and if it is immune to the trip combat maneuver it is immune to this operative exploit. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to attempt to knock a target prone, that creature is immune to your knee shot for 24 hours. This exploit counts as staggering shot for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of other operative exploits.</p>
212	43	Mentalist’s Bane (Ex)	6	<p>If you fail your Will saving throw against a mind-affecting effect with a duration of 1 round or more, you can attempt another saving throw against the effect 1 round later at the same DC. You get only one extra chance to save per effect.<br />If you succeed at a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, you can prevent the effect&rsquo;s originator from knowing you succeeded. You gain basic knowledge of what the mental effect would have made you do or feel, and you can attempt a Bluff check to pretend you are under that effect. If the mental effect would provide a link between you and the originator (like the dominate person spell), you can choose to allow the link without the control.</p>
213	43	Operative's Pounce (Ex)	6	<p>As a standard action, you can make a charge without the normal penalty to attack rolls when attacking on a charge, provided that you use an operative melee weapon to make the attack at the end of the charge. If the attack hits, you can substitute a debilitating trick effect for the damage the attack would deal.</p>
214	43	Richochet Shot (Ex)	6	<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack using a ranged weapon that targets KAC, you can forgo the effects of your debilitating trick to instead ricochet the projectile to a second target. Make a ranged attack at &ndash;6 against the second target and deal normal damage (without trick attack benefits) if the attack hits. You must have line of effect and line of sight both from you to the second target, and from the first target to the second target. When determining your attack penalties from range against the second target, count the full distance from you to the first target, and then the second target.</p>
215	43	Soft Movement (Ex)	6	<p>As a full action, you can move up to twice your speed, ignoring difficult terrain. When moving in this way, any liquid or solid surface will support you, regardless of your weight. You can move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches, and environmental circumstances such as the slipperiness of the area you&rsquo;re moving through or the current wind speed do not adjust the DCs of any Acrobatics or Athletics checks you attempt during this movement. While moving this way, you do not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched while moving in this way, such as from lava, and you don&rsquo;t trigger any traps that use a locationbased trigger. This ability doesn&rsquo;t allow you to move across gases or vacuums, nor does it allow you to move across walls or vertical surfaces (though you can do so if you have an ability that allows you to, such as spider climb). At the end of your turn, this ability ends, and you are subject to any consequence of your location.</p>
216	43	Speed Hacker (Ex)	6	<p>You can disable mechanical devices with Engineering and computer systems with Computers in half the usual time. In the rare cases when disabling a system or device would normally be a full action, you can do it as a standard action, and if it would normally be a standard action, you can do it as a move action.</p>
217	43	Staggering Shot (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to stagger your target. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered until the beginning of your next turn. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to attempt to stagger a creature, that creature is immune to your staggering shot for 24 hours.</p>
218	43	Stalwart (Ex)	6	<p>If you succeed at a Fortitude save against an effect that normally requires multiples successful saves to cure (such as a disease or poison), that effect immediately ends and is cured with a single successful save.</p>
219	43	Sure-Footed (Ex)	6	<p>You move at your full speed when moving over difficult terrain, and without penalty when using Acrobatics or Stealth at your full speed.</p>
220	43	Uncanny Shooter (Ex)	6	<p>Your ranged attacks with small arms do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
221	43	Blinding Shot (Ex)	6	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to temporarily blind a target. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain the blinded condition for 1 round. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to attempt to temporarily blind a creature, that creature is immune to your blinding shot for 24 hours. You must have the bleeding shot exploit to learn this exploit.</p>
222	43	Cloaking Field (Ex)	6	<p>You can bend light around yourself and muffle any minor sounds you make, allowing you to nearly vanish when not moving. Even when you move, you appear only as an outline with blurry features. This cloaking field doesn&rsquo;t make you invisible, but it does make it easier to sneak around. Activating the cloaking field is a move action. While the cloaking field is active, you can use Stealth to hide, even while being directly observed and with no place to hide. Attacking doesn&rsquo;t end the cloaking field, but it does end that particular attempt to hide. If you remain perfectly still for at least 1 round, you gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks (which doesn&rsquo;t stack with invisibility) until you move.<br />Your cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before it becomes inactive. While inactive, the cloaking field recharges automatically at the rate of 1 round of cloaking per minute.</p>
223	43	Deactivating Shot (Su)	10	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to temporarily suppress one magic item or deactivate one weapon, piece of equipment, or armor upgrade worn or carried by the target. Roll 1d20 + your operative level; the DC is equal to 10 + the item level. If you succeed, you deactivate the device (or suppress the item&rsquo;s magical properties) until the beginning of your next turn. The device&rsquo;s owner can spend a move action and attempt an Engineering check (for technological devices) or a Mysticism check (for magic items) against your operative exploit DC to try to reactivate the device.<br />You can instead use this debilitating trick to temporarily deactivate a construct that has either the magical subtype (such as a golem) or the technological subtype (such as a robot). You don&rsquo;t need to attempt a check, but the creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the debilitating effect. If it fails, it&rsquo;s stunned until the beginning of your next turn. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to attempt to deactivate a construct, that creature is immune to your deactivating shot for 24 hours.</p>
224	43	Elusive Hacker (Ex)	10	<p>Your hacking skills make your code incredibly difficult for countermeasures to pin down. Whenever you would trigger a system&rsquo;s countermeasure while hacking the system, there is a 50% chance that you manage to elude the countermeasure and it doesn&rsquo;t trigger. You still haven&rsquo;t disarmed the countermeasure, and it might trigger in the future.</p>
225	43	Ever Vigilant (Ex)	10	<p>You&rsquo;ve been on enough solo missions to know that you can&rsquo;t let your guard down, even while sleeping. You take no penalties to Perception checks for being asleep, though you still can&rsquo;t succeed at purely visual Perception checks while asleep. You can always act on the surprise round, though if you choose to do so when you would otherwise be surprised, you use your initiative result or the initiative result of the first creature that would have surprised you &ndash; 1, whichever is lower.</p>
226	43	Extended Debilitation	10	<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can forgo your trick attack damage to increase the duration of the debilitating trick effect by 1 round. If you have the double debilitation ability, the duration of both debilitating tricks increases. Debilitating tricks with no duration (such as bleeding shot or knee shot) are unaffected.</p>
227	43	Glimpse the Truth (Ex)	10	<p>By picking up on subtle clues and hidden traces in your immediate surroundings, you can see things as they really are. As a full action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain the effects of true seeing for 1 round with a range of 60 feet.</p>
228	43	Holographic Distraction (Ex)	10	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create a single holographic duplicate or psychic projection of yourself that moves away from you for 1 round per operative level. The double climbs walls, jumps across pits, or simply passes through obstacles, moving at twice your speed in one direction indicated by you when the ability is activated. Its course cannot be changed. Those who interact with the double can attempt a Will save to recognize that it is not real. You must have the holographic clone exploit to learn this exploit.</p>
229	43	Improved Evasion (Ex)	10	<p>When you fail a Reflex save against an effect that has a partial effect on a successful save, you take the partial effect instead of the full effect. You must have evasion to learn this exploit.</p>
230	43	Improved Uncanny Mobility (Ex)	10	<p>When you use the trick attack action or take a standard action to move up to your speed, your movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. You still provoke attacks of opportunity normally when making ranged attacks or casting spells. You must have the uncanny mobility exploit to learn this exploit.</p>
231	43	Intelligence Network (Ex)	10	<p>You have access to a secret intelligence network that gets you snippets of information and rumors you can sometimes use to reveal secrets or weaknesses of your rivals. This may be a collection of operatives and spies you have infiltrated, a connection to a formal information broker you trade tidbits of knowledge with, or an assemblage of allies and informants you&rsquo;ve carefully curated over your travels.<br />You can make an inquiry to your intelligence network as long as you have access to an infosphere or communication device with at least system-wide range. This gives you the same information you would gain from casting the vision spell, except you make a special class level check (1d20 + your operative level) in place of a caster level check, it does not require a Resolve Point, and it takes 1d4 weeks for your network to get an answer to you. Your network can work on only one question at a time, and if you make a new request before a previous one is fulfilled, all time spend on the original question is lost, and you take a &ndash;1 penalty to your new class level check due to confusion and lack of focus among your network.</p>
232	43	Master of Disguise (Ex)	10	<p>You can take on the appearances of other creatures and even specific individuals. This functions as the quick disguise exploit, but the duration increases to 10 minutes per operative level. Alternatively, for 1 minute per operative level, you can take on the appearance of a specific individual that you have seen before. If you have heard the individual talk and can speak her language, you can also modulate your speech to match hers. This disguise is so convincing that creatures familiar with the individual must succeed at a Will saving throw before they can attempt a Perception check to pierce the disguise. You must have the quick disguise exploit to learn this exploit.</p>
233	43	Optical Optimization (Ex)	10	<p>If you succeed by 10 or more at the skill check to deal additional damage on a trick attack, you ignore cover or concealment (but not total cover or total concealment) for that attack.</p>
234	43	Psychokinetic Skills (Sp)	10	<p>You can use psychokinetic hand as a spell-like ability at will. You can affect objects weighing up to 10 pounds per operative level you have, or 1 bulk per operative level you have. Additionally, you can use this spell-like ability with the Sleight of Hand skill and to perform the disable device task of the Engineering and Mysticism skills.</p>
235	43	Spider Climber (Su)	10	<p>You can traverse surfaces&mdash;even perfectly smooth or vertical ones&mdash;with as little effort as a spider. You gain spider climb as a constant spell-like ability. If your spider climb spell is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it. You must have a climb speed to choose this exploit.</p>
236	43	Stunning Shot (Ex)	10	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can try to stun your target. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be stunned until the start of your next turn. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to try to stun a creature, it&rsquo;s immune to your stunning shot for 24 hours. You must have the staggering shot exploit to learn this exploit.</p>
237	43	Utility Belt (Ex)	10	<p>You can spend credits to store supplies in your utility belt, effectively depositing credits for later use. The maximum amount is equal to 1,000 credits per operative level you have (2,000 credits per level at 13th level, and 5,000 credits per level at 17th level). As a move action, you can produce any item with light or negligible bulk from your utility belt that does not have a price that exceeds the amount of credits currently deposited in the belt and that has an item level no greater than your operative level &ndash;2. This reduces the number of credits stored in the belt by a value equal to the item&rsquo;s price. Once you have spent the credits deposited in the belt, you must spend 1d4 hours buying supplies in a typical settlement before you can use the utility belt again.</p>
238	43	Versatile Movement (Ex)	10	<p>You gain a climb speed and a swim speed equal to your land speed. This speed is not increased by the quick movement class feature or improved quick movement exploit.</p>
239	43	Audacity (Ex)	14	<p>You can take an unexpected or socially unacceptable action with such total confidence and lack of doubt that the target can&rsquo;t immediately react to it. You can make an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe, but rather than cause them to be shaken on a successful check, you cause them to be dazed for 1 round, and staggered for 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC. Once you have used this ability against a specific target, you cannot target them with it again for 24 hours.</p>
240	43	Dual Specialization (Ex)	14	<p>Select an operative specialization other than your own. Once this choice has been made, it cannot be changed. You gain the 11th level ability granted by the specialization. You are not considered to have the second specialization you selected for purpose of any prerequisite.<br />You must have Skill Focus in the associated skills of the selected specialization, and must have taken its specialization exploit as one of your normal operative exploits.</p>
241	43	Efficient Cloaking Field (Ex)	14	<p>Your cloaking field lasts for up to 100 rounds (10 minutes), and it recharges at the rate of 2 rounds of cloaking per minute while inactive. You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to recharge 20 rounds immediately, and you can do this even while the cloaking field is active. You must have the cloaking field exploit to learn this exploit.</p>
242	43	Knockout Shot (Ex)	14	<p>For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to knock the target out in one blow. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to attempt to knock a creature out, that creature is immune to your knockout shot for 24 hours. You must have the staggering shot and stunning shot exploits to learn this exploit.</p>
243	43	Multiattack Mastery (Ex)	14	<p>When you use triple attack or quad attack to attack the same target with all of your attacks, after your full attack is complete, if at least two of your attacks hit, you can apply a debilitating trick to the target.</p>
244	43	Shadow Slide (Sp)	14	<p>Your mastery of stealth and understanding of the shadows of the Material Plane is so great, you can actually physically walk into the edges of the Plane of Shadow. You must expend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability. It functions as shadow walk, except you can only use it on yourself and items or creatures you can carry, the duration is no more than 1 hour, and you must emerge from the Plane of Shadow back into the plane from which you departed.</p>
245	43	Surveillance Wraith (Ex)	14	<p>You are invisible to technological surveillance systems and most forms of divination magic, per nondetection.</p>
246	43	Uncanny Senses (Ex)	14	<p>Your enhanced senses grow even more discerning. Your blindsense becomes blindsight with a range of 60 feet. If you have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet. You must have the enhanced senses exploit to learn this exploit.</p>
247	53	Solar Armor	1	<p>You can form your solar mote into a suit of armor made out of stellar energy that outlines your body. This armor appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take whatever general shape you choose, whether glowing armored plates of solidified stellar energy, a form-fitting suit of crackling energy, or an aura of stellar plasma. Your solar armor&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function and doesn&rsquo;t give the armor any special abilities. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br />Your solar armor grants you a +1 enhancement bonus to both your Kinetic Armor Class and your Energy Armor Class. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. It is compatible with light armor, but it gives you no benefit if you&rsquo;re wearing heavy armor. At 5th level, you also gain energy resistance 5 while your solar armor is active. You can choose either cold resistance or fire resistance when you activate the armor, and can switch energy types as a move action. This energy resistance increases by 5 at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter.<br />Forming or dismissing solar armor is a move action.</p>
248	53	Solar Flare	1	<p>You can condense your solar mote around one of your hands to form a lightweight ranged weapon of stellar energy. This weapon appears to be made of either glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take any general shape you desire. The shape of normal ranged weapons&mdash;such as pistols, crossbows, and handcannons are fairly common&mdash;but more esoteric manifestations such as a shimmering crystal that launches fragments of itself, a dark aura that forms directly onto your foes, or an orb of stellar energy that releases beams of pure light are also possible. Your solar flare&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function, and it doesn&rsquo;t give the weapon any weapon special properties. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br />Your solar flare functions as a one-handed uncategorized small arm that targets EAC (though it can&rsquo;t be used to make trick attacks, if you have that class feature), and you&rsquo;re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar flare deals cold damage or fire damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar flare deals 1d4 damage and has a range increment of 60 feet. This damage increases by 1d4 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter.<br />Unlike most small arms, when you gain Weapon Specialization at 3rd level, you add your full solarian level to damage with your solar flare, as opposed to half. If you are a multiclass solarian, you add only your full solarian level and half your levels in other classes to damage with your solar flare.<br />Any solarian class features (including stellar revelations and zenith revelations) that specifically affect melee weapons (such as the flashing strikes class feature) function with your solar flare, even if they normally work only with melee attacks. Anything that specifically affects solar weapons (such as solarian weapon crystals) affects your solar flare in the same way, though it can&rsquo;t gain any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion that can&rsquo;t be applied to a small arm.<br />Forming or dismissing a solar flare is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar flare is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>
249	53	Solar Shield	1	<p>You can coalesce your solar mote around one of your hands, creating a deflecting shield of out of stellar energy. This shield appears to be made of either glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take any general shape you desire. Normal defensive implements such as bucklers and kite shields are popular shapes for solar shields, but it is not unheard of for a solarian to bear a solar shield in the form of a shining orrery orbiting their arm, a set of rapidly spinning helicopter blades across their forearm, or stranger barriers. Your solar shield&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function, and it doesn&rsquo;t give the shield any special abilities. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br />Your solar shield grants you a +1 shield bonus to AC (see Shields on page 124), and as a move action you can align the shield to grant you greater protection against one opponent you are observing (Core Rulebook 260), which increases your shield bonus to AC to +2 against attacks from that opponent until the beginning of your next turn. At 5th level and again every 5 levels thereafter, the shield bonus when aligned against one target increases by an additional +1.<br />You can make unarmed attacks with your solar shield; these attacks are not archaic, and you threaten squares within your reach while it is formed. You can add solarian weapon crystals to your solar shield as if it were a solar weapon, in which case their benefits apply to unarmed attacks you make with the shield. The damage type of these attacks is the same damage type as the type granted by the solarian weapon crystal, and if the solarian weapon crystal does not specify a damage type, it deals bludgeoning damage.<br />Forming or dismissing a solar shield is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar shield is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>
250	53	Solar Weapon	1	<p>You can seize your solar mote in one hand to form a melee weapon out of stellar energy. This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn&rsquo;t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br />Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you&rsquo;re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon&rsquo;s damage.<br />Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>
251	54	Graviton Mode	1	<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you&rsquo;re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>
252	54	Photon Mode	1	<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you&rsquo;re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>
253	54	Unattuned	1	<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>
254	55	Black Hole (Su)	1	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully graviton-attuned, as a standard action, you can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet of you closer. You choose which creatures are affected and which ones aren&rsquo;t. Each target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be pulled 10 feet toward you. The range of this revelation and the distance pulled increase by 5 feet at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Solid objects do not block this ability, but any creature that runs into a solid object ceases moving closer to you. Creatures moved by this ability do not provoke attacks of opportunity from this movement. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Black hole functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.</p>
255	55	Supernova (Su)	1	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully photon-attuned, as a standard action, you can deal 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 additional fire damage per solarian level to all creatures within 10 feet of you. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage. At 9th level, you can increase the radius to 15 feet, and at 17th level, you can increase the radius to 20 feet. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Supernova functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.</p>
256	55	Agile Wavelengths (Su)	2	<p>You have developed a technique to conduct maneuvers on the battlefield at range with your solar flare. You can attempt combat maneuvers as a ranged attack instead of a melee attack, with a range of 30 feet. Any weapon special properties your solar flare has that would affect certain combat maneuvers apply as normal. While attuned or fully attuned, you gain a +2 insight bonus to combat maneuvers attempted at range using this stellar revelation. You must have a solar flare to select this stellar revelation.</p>
257	55	Blade in the Night (Su)	2	<p>You have learned how to damage your foes not just with light, but also with the absence of light. As a move action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you. For 1 round, or until you leave graviton mode, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon damage rolls against that creature. This bonus damage increases by 1 at 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter. While attuned or fully attuned, this bonus damage instead increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
258	55	Constructive Interference (Su)	2	<p>Forces humming within your solar armor make it more difficult for sound waves and electrical impulses to reach your body and harm you. You gain energy resistance 5 whenever your solar armor is active. You can choose either electricity resistance or sonic resistance when you activate the armor, and you can switch energy types as a move action.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you double the amount of resistance granted by this ability.</p>
259	55	Dark Matter (Su)	2	<p>As a move action, you can draw on the properties of dark matter to increase your density, allowing you to resist physical damage. You gain damage reduction 1/&mdash;. This increases to DR 2/&mdash; at 6th level and increases by 1 again every 3 solarian levels thereafter. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, your DR from dark matter is equal to half your solarian level.</p>
260	55	Distant Burst (Su)	2	<p>Your solar manifestation is an extension of yourself, and you have learned to center your power outward. Any stellar revelations (including zenith revelations) that have a radius and are centered on you can be centered anywhere within 20 feet of you. While attuned or fully attuned, they can instead be centered anywhere within 40 feet of you.</p>
261	55	Distracting Glare (Su)	2	<p>Your shimmering power draws your enemies&rsquo; focus to the real threat: you. As a move action, you can focus your attention on a creature within 30 feet of you. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. If it fails, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to attack rolls for attacks that don&rsquo;t include you as a target for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.</p>
262	55	Flare (Su)	2	<p>As a move action, you can shed light in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. You choose dim, normal, or bright light each time you activate this revelation. As a standard action, you can create a flash of brilliant light, forcing one creature within 30 feet to succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. Once you&rsquo;ve targeted a creature with flare, you can&rsquo;t target it with this revelation again for 10 minutes. Blind or sightless creatures are not affected by this use of this revelation.<br />When you create a flash of light as a standard action and you are attuned or fully attuned, you can instead choose to make all enemies within range dazzled for 1 round (no save).</p>
263	55	Gravitic Reinforcement (Su)	2	<p>You can shore up your most frustrating weaknesses with balancing gravity. As a move action, you can gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your lowest saving throw for 1 minute, which persists even if you become unattuned, but not if you leave combat or a similar high-stress situation. If multiple saving throws are tied for lowest saving throw, choose one to benefit from this revelation. If you are in graviton mode while benefiting from this revelation, this bonus instead applies to all of your saving throws for as long as you are in graviton mode. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level, and again every 6 levels thereafter.</p>
264	55	Gravity Anchor (Su)	2	<p>As a move action, you can form a gravitational bond between yourself and either the surface you&rsquo;re standing on or the objects you are holding. This grants you a +4 bonus to your AC against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers if you choose the surface underfoot, or against disarm combat maneuvers if you choose objects. The bonus lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode. You can have only one gravity anchor active at a time.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can activate this revelation as a reaction when targeted by a bull rush, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver, in which case it defends against only that attack.</p>
265	55	Gravity Boost (Su)	2	<p>You can increase or reduce the gravitational attraction between yourself and the terrain around you. You can add a bonus equal to one-third your solarian level (minimum +1) to Athletics checks to climb, jump, or swim as part of the action you take to attempt the skill check. In addition, as a reaction when you are falling, you can reduce the falling damage you take by half. At 6th level, you can move along vertical surfaces and even upside down along ceilings for 1 round. This functions as spider climb, but it leaves your hands free and you can also run. You must end your movement on a surface that can support you normally. If you end your movement while you are standing on a vertical surface or ceiling, you fall unless you succeed at an Athletics check to climb to remain in position.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, the bonus you gain from this revelation to checks to climb, jump, or swim doubles.</p>
266	55	Gravity Hold (Su)	2	<p>This revelation allows you to move objects at a distance as per psychokinetic hand (see page 370).<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use the psychokinetic hand ability of your gravity hold to immobilize, lift, or move a Medium or smaller creature. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect. While under this effect, the target creature cannot move, but can take any other normal actions. This ability follows all of the restrictions of the spell other than the weight limit, but you can&rsquo;t lift a creature higher than 5 feet off the ground. When you spend a standard action concentrating to maintain the gravity hold, the target can attempt a new save to end the effect. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this revelation for 24 hours.</p>
267	55	Plasma Sheath (Su)	2	<p>As a move action, you can cause all of your melee attacks to deal fire damage instead of their normal damage type. (The attacks are still made against the target&rsquo;s EAC or KAC as normal for the weapon.) This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, your attacks with plasma sheath deal additional fire damage equal to half your level.</p>
268	55	Radiation (Su)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can emit an aura of low-level radiation. Creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened. A sickened creature recovers as soon as it moves out of your aura, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your radiation for 24 hours. This is a poison effect (see page 415). The radiation lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, the size of your aura increases to 10 feet.</p>
269	55	Stellar Equilibrium (Su)	2	<p>You can draw energy from your connection to the cosmos to regulate your internal temperature and even your physiology. Also long as your solar armor is active, you can exist comfortably in conditions between &ndash;50&deg; and 170&deg; F without needing to attempt Fortitude saves, and you do not need to eat or drink to survive.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you ignore the environmental effects of being in a vacuum and receive a +4 bonus to all saving throws against diseases and poisons.</p>
270	55	Stellar Rush (Su)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can wreathe yourself in stellar fire and make a charge without the penalties (see page 248).<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can substitute a bull rush for the melee attack at the end of the charge. Whether or not you succeed at the bull rush, the target takes 2d6 fire damage (Reflex half). This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>
271	55	Ultraviolet Pulse (Su)	2	<p>You can debilitate your opponents&rsquo; defenses with ultraviolet light. As a standard action, you can focus ultraviolet light on a creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature takes a &ndash;1 penalty to all saving throws for 1 round, or until you leave photon mode. If you are attuned or fully attuned, all creatures within 10 feet of the target take a &ndash;1 penalty to all saving throws for as long as the target is affected by this stellar revelation. If you would become unattuned from using a zenith revelation, the penalty remains until after the zenith revelation is resolved.</p>
272	55	Astrologic Sense (Su)	6	<p>You can sense the movement of all objects influencing you to gain insight into upcoming events. Once per day as a full action, you can try to determine whether a particular action of yours will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. This functions as augury (see page 340) with your effective caster level equal to your solarian level. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this revelation again on the same day, but you still can&rsquo;t use it more than once per hour.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can see 1 hour into the future (instead of half an hour as is normal for augury) when you use this revelation.</p>
273	55	Attractive Force (Su)	6	<p>Your weapon exerts a pull that makes objects cling to it and can even stymie opponents with strands of force. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon, the disarm weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, if you score a critical hit with the weapon, your target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled for 1 round. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the entangling effect.</p>
274	55	Blazing Orbit (Su)	6	<p>As a move action, you can move up to your speed, gaining concealment against any attack made against you during the move, and you can leave a trail of flames in every square you pass through. The flames last for 1 round and deal 2d6 fire damage to anyone who moves into them. You can&rsquo;t move through another creature&rsquo;s space during this movement. If you use blazing orbit again, any flames you previously created with it go out. The damage from the flames increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature damaged by the flames also gains the burning condition (1d6 fire damage; see page 273).</p>
275	55	Corona (Su)	6	<p>As a standard action, you can surround your body with an envelope of fiery plasma. You gain cold resistance 10, and any adjacent creature that hits you with a natural weapon or a melee weapon takes 2d6 fire damage. The corona lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode. At 12th level, the damage increases to 3d6 and the cold resistance increases to 15. At 18th level, the damage increases to 4d6 and the cold resistance increases to 20.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature that starts its turn adjacent to you while your corona is in effect takes fire damage equal to half your solarian level.</p>
276	55	Crush (Su)	6	<p>As a standard action, you can increase the effects of gravity on the internal organs or workings of a target within 30 feet, causing it to have difficulty maintaining its normal functionality. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. This revelation also affects constructs. You can maintain this effect as a move action each round, but the target can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect. Once a creature succeeds at this save or the effect ends, you can&rsquo;t target that creature with crush again for 24 hours.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to also stun the target for 1 round. Maintaining crush on subsequent rounds extends the staggered effect, but not the stunned effect.</p>
277	55	Crushing Force (Su)	6	<p>Your weapons destroy the tools and energy your foes wield against you. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon, the sunder weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode. When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon gains the fatigue critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the fatigue effect.</p>
278	55	Curving Flare (Su)	6	<p>You have developed a technique to use your enemies&rsquo; gravity fields against them, creating a shining ricochet. When you make a ranged attack with your solar flare as a standard action and hit, you can use a move action to make a second ranged attack with your solar flare. This second attack is made at a &ndash;8 penalty (&ndash;6 if you&rsquo;re attuned or fully attuned) and must be made against a different target than the first attack. You determine line of sight and the range of this attack starting from one corner of the space occupied by the target of the first attack. The second attack is treated as an attack in a full attack for the purposes of abilities that reduce the penalties for full attacks. You must have a solar flare to select this stellar revelation.</p>
279	55	Defy Gravity (Su)	6	<p>As a move action, you can fly up to your speed. You must end this movement on solid ground or you fall. At 12th level or higher, you don&rsquo;t have to land if you immediately follow your flight with another move action to use defy gravity. On your last move action of the turn, you still have to land or fall.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, your fly speed from this revelation increases by 10 feet.</p>
280	55	Draining Agony (Su)	6	<p>You can increase the suffering of those who would oppose you. As a reaction while you&rsquo;re attuned or fully attuned, when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes damage from any source, you can add your solarian level to the total damage the creature takes. Once you use this revelation, you can&rsquo;t use it again until the next time you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</p>
281	55	Glow of Life (Su)	6	<p>As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recover a number of Hit Points equal to twice your solarian level. Once you use this revelation, you can&rsquo;t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, increase the amount you heal with this revelation to three times your solarian level.</p>
282	55	Gravity Pulse (Su)	6	<p>Your solar flare has an intrinsic connection to gravitational forces. As a move action, you can grant your solar flare the gravitation (10 ft.) weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode, whichever comes first. When you are attuned or fully attuned, this gravitation property instead has a value of 20 feet. You must have a solar flare to select this stellar revelation.</p>
283	55	Gravity Surge (Su)	6	<p>As a full action, you can perform a disarm or trip combat maneuver against a target within 30 feet. Use your Charisma modifier on your attack roll instead of your Strength modifier, and you gain a +4 bonus to this attack roll that doesn&rsquo;t stack with the bonus from the Improved Combat Maneuver feat.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, if you disarm a target with gravity surge and have a hand free, the dropped item flies toward you and you can snatch it from the air. If you trip a target with gravity surge, you can pull the target up to 10 feet closer to you.</p>
284	55	Hypnotic Glow (Su)	6	<p>As a standard action, you can convince one living creature that you are to be trusted. This functions as charm person (see page 342), but with a duration of 1 round per solarian level you have. When the effect ends, if you are out of line of sight and the target is not engaged in an activity it wouldn&rsquo;t have begun without being charmed, the target does not realize it was charmed or has acted unusually unless someone else points it out. You can&rsquo;t use this revelation again while you currently have a creature charmed via this ability, and once you&rsquo;ve attempted to charm a creature, whether or not the attempt was successful, you can&rsquo;t charm the same creature again for 24 hours. Your influence over the creature ends once the duration has expired, and at that time the target likely ceases doing anything you&rsquo;ve requested of it. At 9th level, hypnotic glow functions as charm monster (see page 342).<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned and you successfully charm a creature using this ability, you can also command it to approach, flee, or halt on its next turn, as per the command spell (no save; see page 343).</p>
285	55	Luminescent Inquisition (Su)	6	<p>Your light shines upon your enemies and reveals the truth. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon or unarmed attacks, the aurora weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode, whichever comes first. When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon also gains the demoralize critical hit effect in addition to its normal critical hit effect.</p>
286	55	Reflection (Su)	6	<p>You can reflect ranged attacks back at your enemies. If you took the total defense action on your last turn, or if you were fighting defensively and spend 1 Resolve Point, as a reaction you can redirect a ranged attack that misses you. Select a new target within 30 feet and make a ranged attack roll with a &ndash;4 penalty. If your attack hits, the new target is damaged as if it had been the intended target of the original ranged attack.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you don't take a &ndash;4 penalty to your redirected attack roll.</p>
287	55	Subduing Beams (Su)	6	<p>While the sun can sear and burn, it also represents a gentler force of growth and redemption. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon, the nonlethal weapon special property by sheathing it in a field of cushioning energy. This lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon gains the staggered critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the staggered effect.</p>
288	55	Vital Reinforcement (Su)	6	<p>You have learned how to use photonic power to bolster your allies in the face of danger. As a reaction while you&rsquo;re attuned or fully attuned, when an ally other than yourself within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can reduce the damage taken by your solarian level (minimum 0 damage). Once you use this revelation, you can&rsquo;t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.</p>
289	55	Burn Enchantment (Su)	10	<p>Your attacks&rsquo; cosmic energy shreds the magical forces wielded by spellcasters. As a move action, you sheathe your body in protective energy that attunes to spellcasters you strike. If the next successful melee attack you make before the beginning of your next turn hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against that creature&rsquo;s spells and spell-like abilities for 1 round.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon gains the dispelling critical effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the dispelling effect. A target affected by the dispelling critical hit effect is the subject of a targeted dispel magic, per the spell, using your solarian level as the caster level.</p>
290	55	Debris Field (Su)	10	<p>As a standard action, you can cause a cloud of debris, microscopic particles, and small items to orbit you, trapped in your personal gravitational field. This grants you concealment against ranged attacks. This ability functions for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, the cloud of debris and microscopic particles thickens, increasing the miss chance from your concealment to 50% on ranged attacks (though you are not considered to have total concealment).</p>
291	55	Forceful Shield (Su)	10	<p>Your solar shield, when imbued with photonic energy, can be used for offense as well as defense. As a full action while holding your solar shield, you can make one melee attack with it, dealing damage as if it were a solar weapon (using your solarian level). You can also use it to make an attack of opportunity if a foe provokes one from you before the beginning of your next turn after you used your solar shield in this way. While attuned or fully attuned, you can align your solar shield against the target of your attack as part of the same full action. If you have a solarian weapon crystal inserted in your solar shield, you apply its benefits to these melee attacks. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation.</p>
292	55	Gravity Well (Su)	10	<p>You have learned how to use your solar manifestation to disrupt the gravitational fields around your enemies. As a full action while attuned or fully attuned, you can make an attack with your solar flare, solar shield, or solar weapon against a single target. If you are able to make this attack as a ranged attack, the target must be within 30 feet. On a hit, the area within a 10-foot radius of your target (including the air) becomes difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to half your solarian level.</p>
293	55	Solar Inferno (Su)	10	<p>You have learned how to create a burst of cosmic energy at the point of your solar manifestation&rsquo;s impact. As a full action while attuned or fully attuned, you can make an attack with your solar flare, solar shield, or solar weapon against a single target. If you are able to make this attack as a ranged attack, the target must be within 30 feet. On a hit, the target and each creature within 10 feet of it must attempt a Reflex save. A creature that fails its save gains the burning condition. This burning condition deals 2d6 damage (increasing by 1d6 at 14th level and again at 18th level).</p>
294	55	Soul Furnace (Su)	10	<p>You can stoke the internal energy of your entire physiology, allowing you to boost your life processes. As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point. If you are suffering from an affliction (a curse, disease, drug or poison), you can immediately attempt an additional saving throw at the affliction&rsquo;s normal save DC. If you succeed at this saving throw, the affliction ends (regardless of how many successful saving throws it normally takes to end the affliction). Once you have used this revelation, you can&rsquo;t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can also use this revelation to end any one of the following conditions you have: bleeding, blinded, burning, cowering, dazzled, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, panicked, shaken, or sickened.</p>
295	55	Stalwart Shield (Su)	10	<p>Your solar shield can imitate the cosmic properties of solar armor, especially when you are properly attuned. As a move action while holding your solar shield, you can gain resistance 5 to cold and fire, which increases by another 5 at 20th level. This resistance lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode, whichever comes first. While attuned or fully attuned, if you use a move action to align your solar shield against a specific target, you increase this resistance by 5 against the abilities and attacks of that target. If you have any items that would specifically benefit solar armor, they apply their benefits to your solar shield while this revelation is active. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation.</p>
296	55	Stealth Warp (Su)	10	<p>You can bend light, sound, and even vibrations around your body, making you harder to notice. As a move action, you can grant yourself a +4 bonus to Stealth checks. This lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use this revelation to reduce your sensory output so much that you can attempt a Stealth check even when you&rsquo;re directly observed and lack cover or a distraction. You are not invisible, simply difficult to see clearly, and if a creature was observing you prior to your Stealth check, it remains aware of your location until you successfully reach cover or concealment. Your stealth warp ends if you make an attack or cause another creature to attempt a saving throw, or at the beginning of your next turn unless you immediately take another move action to use this revelation.</p>
297	55	Binary Shield System (Su)	14	<p>Your bond with your solar shield is strong enough that you can split your focus against multiple foes. When you are fully attuned and use a move action to align your solar shield against a specific target, you can choose a second creature to align your shield against, gaining the full benefits of aligning your shield against both of them. Both creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you align your solar shield against them. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation.</p>
298	55	Gallant Rebuttal (Su)	14	<p>Your solar shield aligns with your cosmic potency to such an extent that you can retaliate with a starry burst against those who seek to harm you. As a reaction when you are attuned or fully attuned and take damage from a creature your solar shield is aligned against, you can cause that creature to take fire damage equal to your Charisma bonus. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation.</p>
299	55	Gravity Shield (Su)	14	<p>As a move action, you can create a minor shield of compressed gravity waves, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to your AC. The shield lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, as a move action, you can create a disk of massive gravitational energies that is capable of deflecting incoming attacks. Choose one edge of your space. The shield extends along three continuous edges in a straight line centered on the chosen edge. The shield provides cover against attacks coming from its far side, but not against attacks originating from the side you&rsquo;re on. If you move, you can reposition your shield as part of your move action, moving it to a different edge of your space. You must use one of your hands to direct and maintain an active gravity shield. You cannot use this version of the gravity shield at the same time you use this revelation to gain a circumstance bonus to your AC. This gravity shield also lasts 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.</p>
300	55	Particle Field (Su)	14	<p>As a move action, you surround yourself with a swirling sheath of charged particles that absorb some damage from attacks made against you. This constantly renewing field of particles acts as a force field that grants 25 temporary Hit Points and has fast healing 4. This lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode. This force field does not function if you also have a force field from an armor upgrade, mechanic&rsquo;s energy shield, or another similar effect.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, the fast healing of your particle field increases to 6.</p>
301	55	Solar Fortification (Su)	14	<p>Gravitational anomalies ripple through your solar armor, providing unexpected protection against devastating hits. As long as your solar armor is active, you gain a 20% chance that a critical hit against you is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll this percentage chance before the critical hit damage is rolled. You must have solar armor to select this revelation.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, the chance that a critical hit against you is treated as a normal attack increases to 40%.</p>
302	55	Sunbolt (Su)	14	<p>As a standard action, you can fire a bolt of concentrated solar energy at one target within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per solarian level you have) as a ranged attack targeting the foe&rsquo;s EAC. If you hit, you deal 9d6 fire damage. If you have a solarian crystal (see Solarian Weapon Crystals on page 170) that changes the type of damage dealt by a solar weapon, you can use it to change the type of damage you deal with your sunbolt. Once you have used this revelation, you can&rsquo;t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.<br />When you are attuned or fully attuned, you gain a +2 bonus to your ranged attack roll to use this revelation.</p>
303	55	Superlative Constellation (Su)	16	<p>Your mastery of photonic energy has developed to such an extent that it flows from you in elegant, rapid patterns. Any photon revelation you have that can be used only once before taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points can now be used up to three times before taking such a rest.</p>
304	55	Superlative Nebula (Su)	16	<p>Your mastery of gravity gives you the ability to flow through combat with ease. Whenever you use a graviton revelation as a move action or standard action, you can take a guarded step as part of the same action. Additionally, when you take Hit Point damage, as a reaction you can use any graviton revelation you have that can be used as a move action. Once you have used a graviton revelation as a reaction with this ability, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina.</p>
305	55	Ultimate Graviton (Su)	16	<p>As your ability to manipulate powers of gravity expands, the range of any graviton revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have with a range doubles. Any graviton revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have that targets a single creature can now simultaneously target two creatures, who must be within 20 feet of each other. You also increase the power of any of the following gravity revelations you have.<br /><strong>Defy Gravity:</strong>&nbsp;Your fly speed increases by 20 feet.<br /><strong>Gravity Anchor:</strong>&nbsp;As a move action, you can gain both types of gravity anchor simultaneously.<br /><strong>Gravity Boost:</strong>&nbsp;Your bonus applies to all Acrobatics checks, and you take no damage from any fall.<br /><strong>Reflection:</strong>&nbsp;If you successfully redirect an attack as a reaction, you can continue to reflect additional attacks until the beginning of your next turn. You have a cumulative &ndash;2 penalty to your redirect attack roll on each reflection attempt after the first. If any reflected attack misses, you can&rsquo;t make further redirect attempts until you use this revelation again.</p>
306	55	Ultimate Photon (Su)	16	<p>Your ability to manipulate powers of light and energy expand greatly. The radius of any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have with a radius expands by 10 feet. Any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) that lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode now lasts for 1d4 rounds if you are not in photon mode. You also increase the power of any of the following photon revelations you have.<br /><strong>Astrologic Sense:</strong>&nbsp;You can see twice as far into the future as normal.<br /><strong>Glow of Life:</strong>&nbsp;You can use this revelation as a swift action, rather than a move action.<br /><strong>Hypnotic Glow:</strong>&nbsp;The charm&rsquo;s duration doubles.<br /><strong>Stellar Rush:</strong>&nbsp;You gain a +2 bonus to your EAC until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
307	55	Constellation Blast	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully photon-attuned, as a standard action, you can create a momentary chain of bursting energy that burns through the terrain. When you use this ability, you create three 10-foot-radius bursts within 60 feet of you, each of which cannot overlap and must be centered no more than 15 feet from the center of one other radius. You deal 5d6 fire damage, plus 1d6 for every 2 solarian levels you have beyond 9th, to each creature in each radius. An affected creature can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. At 17th level, you can create three, four, or five bursts when using this ability.</p>
308	55	Gravitic Calling	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully graviton-attuned, you can call creatures of intense gravity to fight for you as a standard action. This functions as summon creature (Alien Archive 144) with a spell level equal to one-third your solarian level. You select which four creatures you can summon each time you gain a solarian level, and they must all be shadow creatures. Creatures you summon with this ability gain the Coordinated Shot feat.</p>
309	55	Miniature Star (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully photon-attuned, you can create a simulacrum of a star as a standard action. The star is a 10-foot-radius sphere that fills your square (or one square of your space, if you&rsquo;re larger than Medium) and all squares within 5 feet of that space. Any creature that starts its turn in the same space as the star takes 1d6 fire damage for every 2 solarian levels you have, and any creature that starts its turn outside the star but within 5 feet of it takes half that damage. At 17th level, you can create your star simulacrum as a 15-foot-radius sphere that affects your square and all squares within 10 feet of that space (a total of 21 squares).<br />Creatures can move through the star, but it exerts a gravitational pull, and any creature inside it or within 5 feet of it must spend twice as much movement for each square of movement that takes it away from the center of the star. The star remains for 1d4+1 rounds, and stays in place even if you later move. You are immune to all effects of your own miniature star.</p>
310	55	Nebula Storm	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully graviton-attuned, as a standard action, you can create areas of cosmic energy that make it difficult to maneuver. When you use this ability, you create three 10-footradius bursts within 60 feet of you, each of which cannot overlap and must be centered no more than 15 feet from the center of one other radius. These areas become difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to your solarian level, and any creature that starts their turn within this difficult terrain takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, plus 1d6 for every 3 solarian levels you have beyond 9th. An affected creature can attempt a Fortitude save to take half damage. At 17th level, you can create three, four, or five bursts when using this ability.</p>
311	55	Particle Wave (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully photon-attuned, you can dissolve into a Large cloud composed of thousands of flaming pinpoints of brilliance as a standard action. While in this form, you gain a swarm attack that deals 4d6 fire damage, swarm defenses, swarm immunities (Starfinder Alien Archive 157), and a fly speed equal to your land speed. You lose all normal modes of attack and movement, all abilities that depend on your physical form, and any bonus to your KAC and EAC granted by your armor. You can maintain this form for a number of rounds equal to your solarian level. Returning to your normal form before the duration expires requires a standard action. The damage of your swarm attack increases by 1d6 for every 3 solarian levels you have beyond 7th. At 17th level, targets damaged by your swarm attack must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.</p>
312	55	Quantum Entrapment (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully graviton-attuned, you can pull a creature outside the normal confines of space and time. To use this ability, you must succeed at a melee attack against the target&rsquo;s EAC. If you hit the target, it must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted out of reality for 1d4 rounds. The creature is in an extradimensional space that causes it no harm, but it effectively ceases to exist and it cannot be located or contacted by any mundane or magical means. When the duration expires, the creature reappears in the space it last occupied, or in the closest unoccupied space if its original space is now occupied. To the target creature, it seems as if no time has passed during its absence, and it returns exactly in the state it was when it disappeared, including having the same duration remaining on any spells or effects that were affecting it at the time of its departure. At 17th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you hit a creature with this ability to increase its duration to a number of rounds equal to half your solarian level.</p>
313	55	Ray of Light (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully photon-attuned, as a move action, you can transform yourself into a ray of light and move at light speed to any space you can see within long range. Any barrier that would block, reflect, or scatter light prevents you from moving through it. No creature can use a reaction to interfere with your movement or make attacks of opportunity against you unless it&rsquo;s capable of reacting faster than the speed of light. At 17th level, you can touch one willing or unconscious creature to convert it to light and bring it with you as part of the same action.</p>
314	55	Solar Acceleration (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully photon-attuned, you can make a full attack as a standard action. In addition, you and up to six allies within 30 feet are affected by haste (see page 358) for 1 minute after you use this revelation. At 17th level, the extra speed from the haste effect increases to 60 feet (to a maximum of three times the creature&rsquo;s normal speed).</p>
315	55	Solar Incursion	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully photon-attuned, you can invite creatures of fiery power to fight for you as a standard action. This functions as summon creature (Alien Archive 144) with a spell level equal to one-third your solarian level. You select which four creatures you can summon each time you gain a solarian level, and they must all be fire creatures. The natural attacks of creatures you summon with this ability have the limning weapon fusion.</p>
316	55	Starquake (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully graviton-attuned, you can create a violent ripple of movement to knock down your foes. As a move action, you can move up to your speed along the ground without provoking attacks of opportunity. Each creature you are adjacent to at any point during that movement takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. The affected creatures don&rsquo;t need to be standing on solid ground to fall prone, and any that were in the air (but still adjacent to you) fall to the ground on a failed save. The damage increases by 1d8 for every 3 solarian levels you have beyond 7th. At 17th level, you can move up to twice your speed along the ground with this revelation.</p>
317	55	Time Dilation (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully graviton-attuned, you can make time pass more slowly for your enemies. As a standard action, you can project a gravitational wave in a 30-foot cone. You choose which creatures in the cone are affected and which ones aren&rsquo;t. Each target must succeed at a Fortitude save or by affected by slow (see page 377) for a number of rounds equal to your solarian level. At 17th level, even targets that succeed at their saving throws are affected by slow for 1 round.</p>
318	55	Wormholes (Su)	9	<p>When you&rsquo;re fully graviton-attuned, you can create two linked wormholes as a standard action. One wormhole must be adjacent to you, and the other appears anywhere in line of sight within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per solarian level). Each wormhole is 5 feet across and appears at an intersection between two squares. You and any Large or smaller creatures you mentally designate (you can designate &ldquo;all creatures,&rdquo; &ldquo;all lashuntas,&rdquo; or similar categories) can travel between the wormholes. This is considered extradimensional travel. Entering a wormhole instantly transports a creature to a square adjacent to the other wormhole&rsquo;s intersection, where the creature can continue its movement. The wormholes remain for 1 round for every 2 solarian levels you have. At 17th level, you can create three wormholes using this ability, and upon entering the wormhole, a creature can decide which of the other two wormholes to exit.</p>
319	62	Ambusher	1	<p>The ambusher fighting style focuses on stealth, tactical positioning, and superior reflexes to gain an edge. You must have Stealth as a class skill to select this fighting style.</p>
320	62	Arcane Assailant	1	<p>The arcane assailant fighting style supplements its combat effectiveness with magic powers, drawing on traditions of warrior-wizards dating back to well before the Gap. This allows you to use magic runes to augment your weapons and call on legendary powers, giving you access to arcane options even when you don&rsquo;t have a magic weapon in your possession.</p>
321	62	Armor Storm	1	<p>The armor storm fighting style focuses on using armor as a weapon by maximizing the damage of armor-based weapons while withstanding enemy fire. You learn to increase the effectiveness of attacks made with your armor and to add equipment normally beyond your armor&rsquo;s capacity.</p>
322	62	Battlemaster	1	<p>The battlemaster fighting style focuses on adapting your natural advantages to new dangers and situations as they arise. By anticipating particular threats or adjusting mid-combat to deal with specific foes, you can assure your survival and gain the advantage. The following soldier fighting style is an adaptation of this technique that has made its way to the Pact Worlds. You must have the armor savant and natural weapons racial traits to take this fighting style.</p>
323	62	Blitz	1	<p>The blitz fighting style is all about using speed and aggression to get into the thick of melee. You increase your speed and responsiveness, gain abilities that make you better at melee combat than your enemies, and keep on fighting even when surrounded by foes.</p>
324	62	Bombard	1	<p>The bombard fighting style emphasizes attacking multiple targets, often using grenades, and leverages substantial physical strength to control large weapons with significant recoil. At higher levels, you can use launchers, missiles, and other heavy weapons.</p>
325	62	Fourfold Tactician	1	<p>A fourfold tactician is a master of making use of multiple weapons and still having a spare hand. You must have four or more arms to select or use this fighting style.</p>
326	62	Gloom Gunner	1	<p>A gloom gunner has an eldritch connection to the Shadow Plane. By choosing this style, you create this link and use it to infuse your weapon attacks with the dark dimension&rsquo;s uncanny magic. As your martial skill increases, so does your bond to the Shadow Plane. This stronger union with shadow allows you to become a frightening combatant with any armaments you wield.<br />A couple of these features add bonus fusions to a weapon you wield. No weapon can gain a fusion it already has. However, these bonus fusions don&rsquo;t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once.</p>
327	62	Guard	1	<p>The guard fighting style focuses on defense. You become adept at wearing armor, protecting against attacks, and enduring damage and other setbacks from attacks that get through your defenses.</p>
328	62	Hit-and-Run	1	<p>The hit-and-run fighting style focuses on tactical movement as you move in and out of combat. You use ranged weapons but fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to move even when you make full attacks and to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.</p>
329	62	Hunter	1	<p>You&rsquo;re a master of hunting all sorts of creatures, from big-game animals to runaway criminals and similar marks. You may use this expertise as a sniper, trophy hunter, sport enthusiast, or fugitive tracer. Far more focused on skills than other soldiers, your unique talents combine experience in the field with refined combat ability.</p>
330	62	Pistol Dancer	1	<p>A soldier&rsquo;s familiar rifles and heavy weapons are often too obvious for discreet work, but pistols are easily concealed and, in the right hands, elegant engines of death. The pistol dancer combat style teaches you to wield small arms to devastating effect while moving with precision to sidestep the usual tactics employed by other gunfighters.</p>
331	62	Qi Adept	1	<p>You are able to tap into your personal life force, enabling you to unleash incredible strikes upon your foes. Whether you&rsquo;ve discovered these techniques on your own or studied at ancient monasteries and temples devoted to these lost arts, yours is a power cultivated through intense training and skill.</p>
332	62	Sharpshoot	1	<p>The sharpshoot fighting style enables you to excel at making accurate attacks, usually with ranged weapons at a long distance. You can ignore cover and other impediments to your shots, and your attacks are improved by your intense focus.</p>
333	62	Shock and Awe	1	<p>The shock and awe fighting style excels at overwhelming enemies senses with overpowering auditory and visual stimuli. You can modify your weapons to issue thunderous booms or blazing flashes of light, at the same time mitigating these effects with regard to your own senses. This style is strongest with weapons that deal sonic damage or that affect an area.</p>
334	65	Anchoring Arcana (Su; 7th level)	7	<p>As a full action, you can make a single attack with a magic weapon against a single foe. If the attack is a ranged attack, the target must be within the first range increment. Even if the attack normally affects an area or multiple targets, it affects only your selected target. If your attack hits, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to force the target to attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your soldier level + your key ability score modifier). If the target fails its save, it can&rsquo;t voluntarily move from its current space for 1d4 rounds. This has no effect on involuntary movement, but it does prevent the creature from teleporting or moving to another plane. Once you&rsquo;ve struck a foe with this attack, whether it succeeds at or fails its saving throw, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>
335	65	Armored Advantage (Ex)	3	<p>When you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 insight bonus to your Kinetic Armor Class.</p>
336	65	Blazing Strike (Ex)	3	<p>When you hit a creature within 30 feet of you while using a weapon with the bright weapon special property, the radiance partially blinds the target, giving it the dazzled condition for 1 round. If you hit multiple creatures at the same time (such as with an automatic, blast, or explode weapon), only the creature nearest to you or at the center of the explosion (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant) is affected.</p>
337	65	Brutal Blast (Ex)	3	<p>You gain a +2 insight bonus to damage rolls with weapons that have the blast special property (such as a scattergun). This extra damage applies only to creatures within 10 feet of you; creatures farther away take the normal amount of damage. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 soldier levels you have.</p>
338	65	Bullet Barrage (Ex)	3	<p>You gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls for weapons in the projectile category. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 soldier levels you have.</p>
339	65	Caustic Burns (Ex)	3	<p>When you score a critical hit with a weapon from the disintegrator category, you increase its corrode critical hit effect damage by 1d6. If it does not have a corrode critical hit effect, the weapon gains a 1d6 corrode critical hit effect. You can add this corrode critical hit effect to your disintegrator weapon even if it has another critical hit effect.</p>
340	65	Close at Hand (Ex)	3	<p>You have a practiced ease with smuggling weapons. You gain a +2 bonus to Disguise checks to hide the fact that you are wearing armor and to Sleight of Hand checks to conceal weapons on your body. You can draw a concealed weapon as a move action or, if you have the Quick Draw feat, as a swift action.</p>
341	65	Deflecting Smash (Ex)	3	<p>Your weapon&rsquo;s energy deflects incoming attacks. When you make an attack with a melee weapon that has the powered weapon special property, you gain a +1 insight bonus to your EAC until the beginning of your next turn. If your attack is a critical hit, the insight bonus increases to +2.</p>
342	65	Discreet Armor (Ex)	3	<p>You can attempt to conceal the fact you are wearing armor by removing the bulkiest pieces and dressing carefully. Doing so takes 10 minutes of work for light armor and 1d3&times;10 minutes of work for heavy armor and reduces the Armor Class bonus by 1 for light armor or 3 for heavy armor (to a minimum of +0). You can&rsquo;t conceal power armor in this way. Then, roll a Disguise check (with a &ndash;4 penalty if you are concealing heavy armor). This sets the DC of the Perception checks of anyone observing you to notice you are wearing armor. If you are physically searched, the searcher gains a +4 bonus to the check. It takes the same amount of time to return your armor to normal.</p>
343	65	Electric Arc (Ex; 7th level)	7	<p>When you hit a target with a weapon in the shock category, electricity arcs out from your original target to deal electricity damage to a secondary subject within 10 feet of the original target. This damage is equal to the weapon&rsquo;s level. The secondary subject must be the creature nearest to the original target (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant).<br />This gear boost does not function for weapons that have the explode or blast special property. If you use this gear boost with a weapon with the arc critical hit effect (see page 182), your secondary subject for electric arc must be the same as your secondary subject for the arc critical effect.</p>
344	65	Finesse Strike (Ex)	3	<p>You add half your soldier level to damage rolls using weapons with the operative special property.</p>
345	65	Flash Freeze (Ex; 7th level)	7	<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon in the cryo category, that creature&rsquo;s speeds are reduced by 10 feet for 1 round, to a minimum of 10 feet.</p>
346	65	Heavy Onslaught (Ex; 11th level)	11	<p>Your attacks with heavy weapons bypass part of the target&rsquo;s damage reduction. If your heavy weapon does not already overcome the target&rsquo;s damage reduction, treat the target&rsquo;s damage reduction as though it were 5 lower. At 15th level, treat the target&rsquo;s damage reduction as 10 lower.</p>
347	65	Laser Accuracy (Ex)	3	<p>You gain a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls with weapons in the laser category.</p>
348	65	Massive Momentum (Ex)	3	<p>The massive weapons you carry give you more heft when pushing others around. When you successfully perform a combat maneuver to bull rush or reposition a target while wielding a melee weapon with the unwieldy property, increase the result of your melee attack roll by 5 when determining how far you move your target.</p>
349	65	Melee Striker (Ex)	3	<p>Add an additional bonus equal to half your Strength bonus to damage rolls with melee weapons.</p>
350	65	Nimble Juggernaut (Ex)	3	<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re wearing armor (including powered armor), you reduce your total armor check penalty by 1 (minimum 0) and total speed adjustment by 5 feet (minimum adjustment 0 feet). The armor check penalty reduction increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 11th level, you reduce the armor&rsquo;s speed adjustment by 10 feet (minimum adjustment 0 feet). These benefits stack with similar effects, such as from the guard fighting style&rsquo;s 1st-level style technique.</p>
351	65	Plasma Immolation (Ex; 7th level)	7	<p>You are expert at setting things on fire with plasma. If your attack roll with a weapon in the plasma category is a 19 (the d20 shows a 19), and the attack hits your target, the target gains the burning condition. The condition deals 1d4 fire damage if the weapon has an item level of 1st-6th, 1d8 if its item level is 7th-14th, and 2d8 if its item level is 15th or higher.</p>
352	65	Powerful Explosive (Ex; 7th level)	7	<p>When you attack with a weapon with the explode special property and a radius of 10 feet or greater, you can increase the radius of the explosion by 5 feet.</p>
353	65	Raw Lethality (Ex)	3	<p>When wielding weapons with the archaic weapon special property, the damage you deal is never reduced as a result of that property. Archaic weapons you wield gain bleed 1d8 as a critical hit effect (Core Rulebook 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or this bleed effect. The bleed damage increases by 1d8 at 11th level and every 4 soldier levels you have beyond 11th (maximum bleed 4d8 at 19th level).</p>
354	65	Sonic Reasonance (Ex; 7th level)	7	<p>When you hit a creature within 30 feet of you using a weapon in the sonic category, the sonic energy continues to resonate within that creature, giving it the flat-footed condition for 1 round. If you hit multiple creatures at the same time (such as with an automatic, blast, or explode weapon), only the creature nearest to you or to the center of the explosion (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant) is affected.</p>
355	65	Steady Sniper (Ex; 11th level)	11	<p>When you use a move action to aim a weapon with the sniper weapon special property, you can make two attacks with that weapon as a standard action before the end of your turn; you take a &ndash;6 penalty to each of these attacks and must attempt both attacks against the same target. This counts as a full attack for the purpose of any abilities that reduce your penalties to attacks.</p>
356	65	Twinned Threat (Ex)	3	<p>While wielding at least two one-handed melee weapons, when you successfully attack and deal damage with one of those weapons, you gain a +2 insight bonus to damage with all other one-handed melee weapons you wield until the end of your turn. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 soldier levels you have. Additionally, if you are wielding two identical one-handed melee weapons and make a full attack using both, increase the DC of those weapons&rsquo; critical hit effects by 1 until the end of your turn.</p>
357	65	Unarmed Mauler (Ex)	3	<p>Your unarmed strikes gain the wound critical hit effect and are treated as having an item level equal to your soldier level for the purpose of determining save DCs. You can take this gear boost twice. The second time you take it, your unarmed strikes instead gain the severe wound critical hit effect, and the DC to resist this effect increases by 1. If your unarmed strikes already have a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you apply either the unarmed strike&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the wound (or severe wound) critical hit effect granted by this gear boost.</p>
358	65	Unburdened Shield (Ex)	3	<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re wielding a shield, you ignore the shield&rsquo;s armor check penalty and speed adjustment (if any). If the shield has a maximum Dexterity bonus, you also ignore its maximum Dexterity bonus.</p>
359	65	Unstoppable Strike (Ex; 7th level)	7	<p>Your attacks with weapons that deal energy damage slice through part of your target&rsquo;s resistances. If your attack with a weapon does not already overcome the target&rsquo;s energy resistance, treat the target&rsquo;s energy resistances as though they were each 5 lower. At 15th level, treat the target&rsquo;s energy resistances as 10 lower.</p>
360	65	Unyielding Bulwark (Ex)	3	<p>While wearing heavy armor or powered armor, you gain a +4 insight bonus to your AC against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers.</p>
361	72	All-Access Enchantment (Su)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to erode the internal security of a computer system you can touch. You reduce the DC to hack the computer by an amount equal to the level of the spell expended for the duration of a single attempt to hack the computer. If you have used all-access enchantment on a computer and fail a Computers check to access it, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to avoid activating a single countermeasure of your choice.</p>
362	72	Aura Reading (Su)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can scan the auras of creatures and objects within a 30-foot cone to learn about them. You must have line of sight to a target to scan it. By scanning the auras of creatures and items, you gain a +2 insight bonus to checks to identify them. If you successfully identify a creature or an item after scanning it, you learn one more useful piece of information than normal. If you scan an injured creature or damaged item, you gain a +2 insight bonus to your next Medicine or Engineering check to treat or repair it, provided you initiate the process that leads to the check within 10 minutes.</p>
363	72	Calculate Trajectory (Ex)	2	<p>As a move action, you can predetermine all potential outcomes and variables before attacking a foe with a spell to consistently strike them at their most vulnerable spot, forcing the target to rely on its reflexes to avoid your attack. If you cast a spell that requires a melee attack or ranged touch attack to affect a target before the end of your next turn, you automatically hit your target, but your foe can attempt a Reflex save to negate your spell&rsquo;s effect (calculating your spell&rsquo;s save DC normally).</p>
364	72	Countertech (Su)	2	<p>As a reaction when you take damage from an attack by a technological weapon or source within medium range that specifically targets you, you can expend an unused spell slot to disrupt the attack. With a spell slot of 1st to 5th level, you can counter an attack from a technological weapon whose item level is equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot &times; 3, to a maximum of your caster level. 6th-level spell slots can counter any weapon with a level equal to or less than your caster level. For example, at 2nd level, you could expend a 1st-level spell slot to counter an attack from a 1st- or 2nd-level weapon. To successfully counter the attack, you must roll a countertech check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the weapon&rsquo;s level. If the countertech check succeeds, the attack deals half damage. If the countertech check fails, the attack deals normal damage. This magic hack only affects attacks that target you directly; you cannot use countertech against attacks that target an area or that target another person.</p>
365	72	Direct Denial of Shapechanging (Su)	2	<p>When you cast a polymorph spell (Alien Archive 2 145) on a target with the shapechanger subtype and that target attempts to end your polymorph effect using its change shape ability, that foe must attempt a Will save. If the foe fails its Will save, it fails to transform into the form allowed by its change shape ability and can&rsquo;t attempt to do so again for the rest of your polymorph spell&rsquo;s duration.</p>
366	72	Empowered Weapon (Su)	2	<p>As a move action, you can expend an unused spell slot to reconfigure and enhance a weapon you&rsquo;re wielding. Until the start of your next turn, your attacks with the enhanced weapon gain a bonus to attack rolls equal to the level of the spell slot you expended. In addition, your attacks with that weapon deal 1d6 additional damage per level of the expended spell slot. This damage is of the same type the weapon normally deals.</p>
367	72	Energize Spell (Ex)	2	<p>Once per day as a move action, you can use a battery or a weapon&rsquo;s power cell to power your spellcasting, enabling you to cast one spell you know without using a spell slot. This expends 20 charges per spell level from the battery or power cell and requires you to touch the battery, power cell, or weapon. You must cast the spell before the start of your next turn, or the charges are wasted with no effect.</p>
368	72	Fabricate Tech (Sp)	2	<p>As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily construct a piece of technological gear from raw magic. You can create any single technological item with a level equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot &times; 3, to a maximum of your caster level. The item appears in your hands or in an adjacent square. You can use fuse spells with this magic hack. The size of the item cannot exceed 10 bulk or Medium size, and the quality of the item is average. Treat this as a spell of the same level as the expended spell slot. For example, at 4th level, you could expend a 1st-level spell slot to fabricate an item of up to 3rd level, or you could expend a 2nd-level spell slot to fabricate an item of up to 4th level. The item persists for a number of minutes equal to your technomancer level. At the end of this duration, the item disappears. You can&rsquo;t create armor, weapons, magic items, or items with limited uses or charges (such as batteries, drugs, or fuel) with this hack.</p>
369	72	Harmful Spells (Ex)	2	<p>When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage, you can increase the spell&rsquo;s damage by half your technomancer level. This increased damage applies to all creatures damaged by an area spell, but for spells that target multiple creatures with multiple rays or other attacks (such as magic missile), the increased damage applies only to a single ray or missile. This increased damage doesn&rsquo;t apply to ongoing damage from the spell (such as bleed or burn). This magic hack doesn&rsquo;t increase ability damage or other spell effects, only damage to Stamina Points or Hit Points.</p>
370	72	Magic Trajectories (Su)	2	<p>As a move action, you can augment a technological powered weapon (either a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered weapon special property) so its wielder can exclude a number of targets equal to your key ability modifier from any attacks made by the weapon for 5 rounds. You can do this to a weapon in your possession or one held by an ally that is within reach at the time you use this ability. Each time an attack is made with the weapon, the attacker can exclude targets they are aware of. This exclusion applies only to instant effects and critical hit effects, such as damage or bleed, not lingering secondary effects such as creating a cloud of smoke.<br />After you use this ability, you cannot do so again until after you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>
371	72	Psylore (Su)	2	<p>You attune yourself to the psychic energy of other beings, gaining the insight bonus from your techlore class feature to Sense Motive checks.</p>
372	72	Quick Scan (Su)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can get a general sense of what information is stored on drives or other digital storage media. You must pass your hand in the air near the data source, but don&rsquo;t have to touch it or connect to it. The information you get is very general, such as &ldquo;financial records,&rdquo; &ldquo;military records,&rdquo; or &ldquo;spells.&rdquo; Getting detailed information requires interfacing with the data more directly. If you attempt a quick scan on a creature that stores its memories in a digital medium&mdash;to get a sense of the memories stored in a robot, for example&mdash;the target can attempt a Will save to negate the scan and prevent you from trying against it again for 24 hours.</p>
373	72	Recode Gem (Su)	2	<p>You can alter the spell contained within the encoded lattices of a spell gem. This requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration. You hijack the power within the gem by inserting your own spellcode, replacing the spell originally encoded within the gem with one of your spells known of an equal or lower level. You can&rsquo;t insert a replacement spell with expensive material components or that requires the expenditure of Resolve Points unless the original spell required components of equal or greater value or the same amount of Resolve Points. If you use this ability on a compound spell gem, it affects only one spell contained within the gem, leaving the other spell or spells intact. Once you have used this ability, you cannot recode another spell gem until you rest for 10 minutes and expend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points.</p>
374	72	Robot Influence (Ex)	2	<p>You can affect constructs, robots, and other creatures that have the technological subtype with your mind-affecting spells, even if they&rsquo;re mindless or normally immune to such effects. However, they receive a +2 bonus to their Will saves against your mind-affecting spells.</p>
375	72	Selective Targeting (Ex)	2	<p>When you cast an instantaneous spell with an area effect, you can shape the spell so it doesn&rsquo;t affect one of your allies. Choose one 5-foot square within the spell&rsquo;s area to be unaffected by the spell. At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to exclude any number of squares with this ability.</p>
376	72	Spell Countermeasures (Ex)	2	<p>You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
377	72	Subtle Spells (Ex)	2	<p>You can disguise your spellcasting to confound onlookers. If you succeed at a Sleight of Hand check (DC = 10 + 5 &times; level of spell being cast) while casting a spell (this requires no extra action), choose a different spell of the same level and school as the one you are casting. An onlooker who succeeds at a Mysticism check to identify the spell you are casting believes the disguised spell to be the other spell you chose unless their result exceeds the DC by 10 or more. A spell with an obvious effect (such as explosive blast) will immediately disabuse of the onlooker of their false assumption. You can&rsquo;t actually eliminate all signs of spellcasting, so security footage may still reveal you as the source of dangerous magic.<br />Starting at 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to automatically succeed on the Sleight of Hand check. When you do so, the onlooker takes a &ndash;2 penalty to a Mysticism check to identify your spell and the DC to counter your spell with dispel magic or greater dispel magic increases by 2.</p>
378	72	Summon Cache (Sp)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can teleport your spell cache to your hand, even if another creature is currently holding it. This ability functions across any distance, as long as your spell cache is on the same plane as you, though it can&rsquo;t teleport through effects that prevent teleportation. You can choose this magic hack only if your spell cache is an item.</p>
379	72	Technomantic Proficiency (Ex)	2	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily learn how to use a weapon in combat. Choose a single weapon; you gain proficiency with it (and any identical weapon) for a number of minutes equal to your class level. Each round you use the weapon reduces this magic hack&rsquo;s duration by 1 minute. For example, at 4th level, you could gain proficiency with corona laser rifles for 4 minutes. If you fire such a weapon for 2 rounds, you remain proficient with it for 2 more minutes.</p>
380	72	Adaptable Spell Knowledge (Ex)	5	<p>Choose three technomancer spells that you do not know, each with a level equal to or less than the highest spell level you can cast. As a move action, you can add one of these spells to your list of technomancer spells known for 1 minute. If you have the cache capacitor class feature and you could add that spell to one of your cache capacitor&rsquo;s slots, you can add the spell to your cache capacitor during this time to extend its duration as described by that class feature. You can use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use adaptable spell knowledge again before the duration expires, you replace the previous spell with your new choice. Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one spell you selected with this ability with another choice.</p>
381	72	Arcane Virus (Sp)	5	<p>You can program a virus into a technological item or weapon that delivers a spell effect, similar to the effects of a spell gem, on the next individual to use the item. This process requires an uninterrupted minute of access to the item. You can create only an arcane virus of a spell you know that has a range of at least short and affects at least one target or has an area of effect, and you must expend an unused spell slot of the level of the spell you are programming into the virus. All of the spell&rsquo;s variables are determined by your technomancer level at the time of its creation, and any decisions regarding its effect (such as with command) must be set when the virus is created. The arcane virus affects only the creature that triggered it, even if the original spell would affect more than one creature. An arcane virus remains active until it is triggered, until it is disabled, until you decide to end it as a standard action, or for 1 day per your technomancer level, whichever comes first. While the arcane virus is active, you cannot recover the used spell slot until the virus is triggered or deactivated. A user can detect an arcane virus before it is triggered with a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + your technomancer level + level of the spell) and disable it with a second Computers check (DC = 20 + your technomancer level + level of the spell).</p>
382	72	Cache Concentration (Su)	5	<p>Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of concentration, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to automate the concentration process by transforming the necessary concentration into a program loop that your spell cache can maintain for you. If the spell has a maximum duration, your spell cache maintains the spell for that maximum duration, during which you can act normally. Otherwise, your spell cache maintains the spell until you interrupt the program loop, which does not require an action. Your spell cache can loop only one spell at a time, and if you use this ability to loop a new spell while your spell cache is already looping a spell, the spell cache immediately stops concentrating on the previous spell.<br />You must have the spell cache class feature to choose this magic hack.</p>
383	72	Charging Jolt (Su)	5	<p>As a move action, you can expend an unused spell slot to refill charges in a weapon&rsquo;s power cell. This requires you to touch the weapon or its power cell. The power cell regains 10 charges per spell level, up to its capacity. You can also use this ability to jump-start or short out an electronic device, allowing you to attempt an Engineering check to disable a device with a bonus equal to double the level of the spell you expended.</p>
384	72	Debug Spell (Ex)	5	<p>Any piece of code has bugs, but you can turn the bugs in your spellcode into features. After rolling damage for an instantaneous spell that deals Hit Point damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll one die with a result of 1 (see page 243). At 11th level, you can reroll up to two dice with a result of 1, and at 17th level, you can reroll up to three dice with a result of 1. For example, if you were 17th level and cast disintegrate, you could spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll up to three dice that rolled 1s, after rolling and seeing how many 1s you rolled.</p>
385	72	Distant Spell (Ex)	5	<p>When you cast a spell with a range of close, medium, or long, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to double its range. Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, do not benefit from this magic hack. If the spell affects an area, doubling its range doesn&rsquo;t alter the size of its area.</p>
386	72	Enchanted Fusion (Su)	5	<p>As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily grant the effects of a weapon fusion to a weapon that you touch. When you activate this ability, choose from the following weapon fusions: flaming, frost, ghost killer, merciful, or shock. If you expend a spell slot of 4th, 5th, or 6th level, you gain the ability to choose either the corrosive or thundering fusion. The weapon gains the chosen fusion for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot you expended. The weapon can&rsquo;t gain a fusion it already has or one that can&rsquo;t be applied to a weapon of its type, but this bonus fusion doesn&rsquo;t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once. You must have the empowered weapon magic hack to choose this magic hack.</p>
387	72	Energy Alteration (Su)	5	<p>When you cast a spell that deals damage with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can cast the spell as a full action to change the type of damage it deals to any one of the following: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. If the spell requires an attack roll to hit, changing its damage type does not change whether it targets EAC or KAC. You can spend 1 Resolve Point when casting a spell that deals damage to apply the effects of this magic hack without adjusting the spell&rsquo;s casting time.</p>
388	72	Extended Spell (Ex)	5	<p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to double its duration. This has no effect on spells with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, 1 round or less, or permanent, nor can it increase a spell&rsquo;s duration to more than 24 hours.</p>
389	72	Fabricate Arms (Su)	5	<p>As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily construct a technological weapon or suit of armor out of raw magic. You can create one suit of armor or weapon with a level equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot &times; 3, to a maximum of your caster level. The item appears in your hands, on your person, or in an adjacent square. You can use fuse spells with this magic hack. A weapon can&rsquo;t be larger than two-handed, and the size of the item can&rsquo;t exceed 10 bulk. The quality of the item is average for its type. Treat this as a spell of the same level as the expended spell slot. For example, at 10th level, you could expend a 3rd-level spell slot to fabricate a weapon of 9th level or lower, or expend a 4thlevel spell slot to fabricate a suit of armor of 10th level or lower. The armor or weapon persists for a number of rounds equal to your technomancer level. At the end of this duration, the item disappears. You are proficient with (but not specialized in) any weapons you create with this ability. You can&rsquo;t create magic items, weapons made from a special material, or weapons that are expended with use (such as arrows, grenades, or missiles) with this magic hack.</p>
390	72	Glitch Step (Su)	5	<p>You can expend a 1st-level or higher spell slot to glitch yourself out of reality, as if you were an image on a bad view screen, allowing you to move in unpredictable ways. You must use this ability as part of a move action to move your speed or a withdraw action, and it provides you with one of the following benefits. You can use this ability only once per move action.</p><ul><li>Ignore 20 feet of difficult terrain. This increases to 40 feet of difficult terrain if you expend a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, and 60 feet of difficult terrain if you expend a 5th- or 6thlevel spell slot.</li><li>Move 10 feet. This counts as 5 feet of movement, but you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving this way. Any other movement you attempt as part of your move action provokes reactions as normal. This increases to 20 feet if you expend a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, and 30 feet if you expend a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot.</li><li>Pass through up to 1 foot of solid objects as if you were incorporeal (Core Rulebook 264). You can pass through ceilings, floors, and walls, provided they&rsquo;re no thicker than 1 foot. This increases to 5 feet of solid objects if you expend a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, and 10 feet of solid objects if you expend a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot.</li></ul>
391	72	Magic Negation (Sp)	5	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 RP to temporarily suppress magic, as if using dispel magic. Choose either an ongoing spell or a magic item within 30 feet of you. The magical effects of the spell or magic item are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, and then they return. If the spell&rsquo;s level is higher than you can cast or the item&rsquo;s caster level is greater than yours, you can&rsquo;t suppress it. If you target a spell affecting a creature, the creature can attempt a Will save to stop you from suppressing the spell.</p>
392	72	Private Hologram (Su)	5	<p>When you cast a holographic image or holographic terrain spell, you can choose to adjust the illusion&rsquo;s magical frequency to make it visible only to you and a single target of your choosing within range who you can observe. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to instead make the illusion perceivable to a number of targets equal to your technomancer level. A private hologram can be seen by any effect that allows someone to see invisible creatures.</p>
393	72	Shadow Grenade (Su)	5	<p>As a standard action, you can create and throw a quasi-real duplicate of a grenade you have in your possession. You don&rsquo;t need to have the grenade in hand, but you do have to have it easily accessible (essentially any grenade that would be a legal target of the Pull the Pin feat). To use this ability, you must expend a spell slot of a spell level equal to at least half the item level of the grenade to be thrown (minimum spell level 1).<br />The shadow grenade acts in all ways like a standard grenade of the type being duplicated, except you are proficient with it, and any creature that makes a saving throw against it is immune to all its effects. If the grenade would not normally allow a saving throw, creatures in its area can attempt a Will save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 your technomancer level + your key ability modifier. This also applies if the grenade requires a saving throw only under specific circumstances that don&rsquo;t apply to a creature. For example, if you use this ability to create a shadow smoke grenade, any creature that inhales the shadow smoke attempts a Fortitude save as outlined in that item&rsquo;s description (Core Rulebook 184) and on a success is immune to all the grenade&rsquo;s effects (including any cover it would grant). Creatures that do not inhale the grenade&rsquo;s shadow smoke are still allowed a Will save, as outlined above, to ignore all the grenade&rsquo;s effects (including cover).<br />You can use this ability to duplicate a grenade with a weapon fusion or fusion seal, but for the purpose of determining the level of the spell slot you must expend to use this ability, treat the grenade&rsquo;s item level as equal to its base item level + the level of any fusions.</p>
394	72	Spell Grenade (Sp)	5	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point to store a spell with a range of touch in a grenade, allowing you to affect a target within the grenade&rsquo;s blast radius with the spell. Casting a spell with spell grenade uses the spell&rsquo;s standard casting time, and throwing the spell grenade is a standard action. You must throw the grenade before the end of your next turn, or the spell is wasted. You are considered proficient with the grenade for this attack. Choose a single target within the grenade&rsquo;s blast radius; that target is affected by the spell as if you had successfully touched it. The grenade goes off as normal, with all of its usual effects within its blast radius. If you miss the targeted intersection with the grenade, you must choose a target within the grenade&rsquo;s new blast radius. If there are no suitable targets within the grenade&rsquo;s blast radius, the spell is wasted. Spells whose ranges are not touch don't benefit from this magic hack.</p>
395	72	Brain Hacker (Su)	8	<p>To you, living brains are merely a type of organic computer, and you&rsquo;ve learned to hack them as easily as you would an artificial mind. For the purpose of determining the effects of your technomancer spells, you treat all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher as if they were both their original type and subtype and constructs with the technological subtype, whichever is more beneficial for you. This ability allows you to heal living creatures with spells like mending and make whole, as if they were constructs.</p>
396	72	Diviner’s Tap (Su)	8	<p>You can hack a computer to set up magical surveillance. This takes 10 minutes and requires a successful Computers check against the device&rsquo;s DC. If you fail, you can&rsquo;t try again on the same device. On a success, your tap lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. You can program your tap either to give you general information about user activity on the device or to receive a mental alarm when a user accesses or transmits data about a specific topic (getting an idea of the information found). For instance, a user might hold a video call to talk about your exploits. If you chose to receive general information, you might know that a video call took place but not the call&rsquo;s topic. If you chose to have the tap receive an alarm when the topic is you, you&rsquo;d get the gist of the conversation (but not a complete transcript). Setting up a new diviner&rsquo;s tap ends the duration of any previous one still in effect.</p>
397	72	Drone Summoner (Su)	8	<p>When you cast summon creature (Alien Archive 144) to summon a robot, you can grant that robot a number of benefits as if it were a mechanic&rsquo;s drone you controlled. If you summon multiple robots with a single creature summoning spell, you select one of them to receive these benefits. You can give it commands if it is within 100 feet of you, as if you had limited telepathy that functioned with the robot.<br />For every 4 caster levels you have, you can select one additional benefit to grant the robot, up to a maximum number of benefits equal to the spell level of the spell you used to summon it. Each time you gain a new technomancer level, you can change what benefits you have selected. When you summon a robot with a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144), you can decide what benefits it receives from those you have selected, up to its maximum.<br />The benefits you can select from include bonus feats and drone mods. The bonus feats you can select from are Blind-Fight, Cleave, Far Shot, Jet Dash, Kip Up, and Mobility. The drone mods you can select from are camera, cargo rack, climbing claws, enhanced senses, hardened AI, hydrojets, jump jets, speed, and tool arm (you must define the tool when you select this benefit).<br />You must be able to cast summon creature (Alien Archive 144) to summon a robot to select this magic hack.</p>
398	72	Extend Runtime (Su)	8	<p>You hack a spell&rsquo;s runtime, dramatically increasing its duration. Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of 10 minutes/day or longer and target only yourself, you can either spend 1 Resolve Point or cast the spell using a higherlevel spell slot to increase its duration to 24 hours (D).</p>
399	72	Fabricate Explosive (Sp)	8	<p>As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to concentrate its magical power into a grenade-like matrix of volatile energy. This fabricated explosive can mimic any grenade with an item level equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot &times; 3, to a maximum of your caster level. This grenadelike item remains a spell-like ability with a spell level equal to the level of the spell slot you expended, and it cannot be augmented or affected by abilities that affect technological devices or weapons. This explosive is unstable; only you can use it, and you must throw it within a number of rounds equal to the level of the expended spell slot or it dissipates harmlessly. You are considered proficient with the grenade for this attack. Once you have used this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you rest for 10 minutes and expend 1 Resolve Point to recover Stamina Points.</p>
400	72	Flash Teleport (Sp)	8	<p>As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to teleport up to 30 feet. You must have line of sight to your destination. This movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
401	72	Mental Mark (Su)	8	<p>When an enemy fails a Will save against one of your technomancer spells, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to saving throws and AC for 1 round. When an enemy succeeds at a Will save against one of your technomancer spells, it takes a &ndash;1 penalty to saving throws against your spells for 1 round. A creature can take only one penalty from a mental mark at a time.</p>
402	72	Spell Static (Su)	8	<p>If you have the spell countermeasures magic hack, as a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to extend that protection to creatures of your choice within 30 feet. This protection lasts 1 round per technomancer level you have, even if the creature subsequently moves more than 30 feet away from you. A creature can benefit from this ability again only after it has taken a 10-minute rest from which it could regain Stamina Points.</p>
403	72	Spellshot (Sp)	8	<p>You can cast an area spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less through a ranged weapon, allowing you to use the weapon&rsquo;s range rather than the spell&rsquo;s range. You must target a single creature with your attack, and the spell&rsquo;s area is centered on that creature, or originates at the creature&rsquo;s location for a cone or line effect (oriented in whichever direction you choose), even if the spell would normally be centered on or originate from a point. You can fire the weapon as part of the standard action to cast the spell. You must fire the weapon during the round that the casting is completed, or the spell is wasted. If the attack misses, the spell is wasted. Spells with an emanation effect that would be centered on you don&rsquo;t benefit from this magic hack.</p>
404	72	Tech Countermeasures (Su)	8	<p>As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make it more difficult for enemies to target you with technological weapons for 1 round. Until the start of your next turn, as a reaction just before an enemy attacks you with a technological weapon, you can force that enemy to roll the attack twice and take the lower result; if the weapon allows a Reflex save instead of requiring an attack roll, you instead gain the benefit of evasion (as the operative&rsquo;s class feature; see page 93) against the attack. This magic hack has no effect on spells that target you or on weapons or attacks that are not technological in nature.</p>
405	72	Translocational Recall (Su)	8	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create a translocational beacon that you place anywhere within your reach. As a swift action, you can instantly teleport from your current location to the location where you placed your translocational beacon, provided the beacon has at least 1 Hit Point and is no further than 10 feet &times; your technomancer level from your current location. This movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity, although it does create a dazzling flash of neon light (Perception DC 0 to notice).<br />A transdimensional beacon is a Fine object with negligible bulk, hardness equal to your technomancer level, and Hit Points equal to 3 &times; your technomancer level. Your spell cache monitors your beacon, and you are automatically alerted if it is destroyed or you move out of its range. You can have only one beacon active at a time, and creating a new beacon causes the old beacon to immediately collapse and become inert.</p>
406	72	Widened Spell (Ex)	8	<p>When you cast a spell with a burst, emanation, or spread, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to double its radius. For instance, a spell with a 30-foot burst would have a 60-foot burst instead. Spells that don&rsquo;t have an area of one of these three types are not affected by this magic hack.</p>
407	72	Arcane Spyware (Sp)	11	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point while touching a single technological item (including a weapon or a suit of armor) and infect it with a sly program that seeks out a user&rsquo;s secrets on your behalf. The spyware can be instructed to attack the very next user or remain dormant, waiting for a specific target. The spyware lasts for a number of hours equal to your technomancer level or until it is activated, at which point it targets the user as per mind probe with a caster level equal to your technomancer level. The duration of this effect is 1 minute per level and the spyware can attempt to extract information only once per minute. The spyware is subtle, but a user may notice it each time it attempts to extract a memory with a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; your technomancer level), and the spyware can&rsquo;t continue to target a user who puts the item down or walks away. You are aware of the spyware&rsquo;s activity and what information it extracts, and you can direct its line of questioning, as long as you are within 1 mile of the infected item.</p>
408	72	Countertech Sentinel (Su)	11	<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use your countertech magic hack to counter a direct attack against an ally within 15 feet. You can't use countertech sentinel against attacks that target an area. You must have the countertech magic hack to choose this magic hack.</p>
409	72	Diminish Spell Runtime (Su)	11	<p>As a standard action, you can attempt to hack an active spell effect that you&rsquo;re aware of to reduce its duration. You must be able to touch the area, creature, or object affected by the spell that you want to hack. As part of the hack, attempt a Mysticism check with a DC equal to 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the caster level of the spell. If you succeed, you reduce the spell&rsquo;s duration by 50%. If this reduces its duration to less time than the effect has already been active, the spell ends as if dispelled. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you can&rsquo;t attempt to hack that spell again for 24 hours. This ability does not affect spells with an instantaneous or permanent duration.</p>
410	72	Eternal Spell (Ex)	11	<p>Choose one 1st-level spell you know from the list of technomancer spells in the Starfinder Core Rulebook. You can cast it at will, as though it were a 0-level spell. It still counts as one of your 1st-level spells known, not one of your 0-level spells known. You can choose a 1st-level spell from a source other than the Core Rulebook with the GM&rsquo;s permission.</p>
411	72	Mind Virus (Su)	11	<p>You implant a psychic countermeasure in your mind to protect against intrusion, much like computer security. When you attempt a Will saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, the creature using the effect on you must also attempt a Will saving throw. On a failure, the target is nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Even if the target succeeds at the Will save, it is sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
412	72	Reactive Counter (Su)	11	<p>Whenever an opponent you&rsquo;re aware of casts a spell, as a reaction you can cast dispel magic or greater dispel magic in an attempt to counter the spell, even if you didn&rsquo;t ready an action or select that opponent. This magic hack doesn&rsquo;t allow you to cast a spell that you don&rsquo;t know, and you must expend a spell slot of the appropriate level to cast dispel magic or greater dispel magic in this way.<br />You must know dispel magic or greater dispel magic to select this magic hack.</p>
413	72	Reboot Mind (Su)	11	<p>You can free someone from magical mental control or conditions. As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point and touch a willing creature. This restarts the subject&rsquo;s brain, ending all mind-affecting effects affecting it, as well as all conditions that could be removed by greater remove condition that were imparted on the creature by mindaffecting effects, but the subject becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. Once you reboot a mind, you can&rsquo;t use this ability again for 24 hours.<br />You can attempt to reboot the mind of an ally who is unwilling due to the influence of a mind-affecting effect. In this case, the ally can attempt a new saving throw against the effect at the same DC. If she succeeds, the ally can allow her mind to be rebooted, but if she fails, you waste the expended Resolve Point and action.<br />You can use this ability to reboot your own mind. If you&rsquo;re unable to take actions, you can reboot your mind without spending actions, but it must be the first thing you do on your turn, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
414	72	Seeking Shot (Su)	11	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to fire a single shot from a ranged weapon at a target known to you within range. The shot travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the weapon&rsquo;s range prevents the shot from reaching the target. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.</p>
415	72	Phase Shot (Su)	14	<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to fire a single shot from a ranged weapon at a target known to you within range. The shot travels straight to the target, passing through any nonmagical barrier in its way, ignoring hardness and Hit Points (any magical barrier, such as a wall of force, stops the shot). This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.</p>
416	72	Quickened Spell (Ex)	14	<p>You can cast a spell as a move action. You can spend 2 Resolve Points to cast a quickened 0-level spell or 4 Resolve Points to cast a quickened 1st-level spell. You can quicken only spells with a casting time of 1 full action or shorter. At 16th level, you can spend 6 Resolve Points to cast a quickened 2nd-level spell.</p>
417	72	Rain of Fire (Su)	14	<p>Once per day as a full action, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to shoot a ranged weapon at multiple targets within range; the maximum number of targets is equal to half your technomancer level or the number of shots in your weapon, whichever is lower. Each attack uses your highest attack bonus, and each enemy can be targeted only by a single shot.</p>
418	72	Spell Library (Ex)	14	<p>You gain one extra spell known for each level of spell you can cast. You must choose the new spells when you gain this magic hack. If you gain access to a higher level of spell after choosing this hack, you gain one extra spell known for that spell level.</p>
419	72	Phasing Spellshot (Sp)	17	<p>When you use your spellshot magic hack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a part of casting the spell to allow the attack to travel straight to the target, passing through any nonmagical barrier in its way, ignoring hardness and Hit Points (although any magical barrier, such as a wall of force, stops the shot). This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. You must have the spellshot and phase shot magic hacks to select this magic hack.</p>
420	80	Basic Booster	1	<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p><ul><li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li><li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li><li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li></ul>
421	80	Basic Inhibitor	1	<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature&rsquo;s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p><ul><li>The target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC.</li><li>You reduce the target&rsquo;s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li><li>You reduce the target&rsquo;s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li></ul><p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>
422	80	Minor Biohacks	1	<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don’t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>
423	82	Genetics	1	<p>You can use the following ability when you achieve the breakthrough for this field of study.</p>
424	82	Immunology	1	<p>Immunology is the study of how living creatures’ bodies fight off diseases and other maladies.</p>
425	82	Neurochemistry	1	<p>Neurochemistry is the study of the chemicals that affect creatures’ brains and nerves (or related cognitive systems).</p>
426	82	Pharmacology	1	<p>Pharmacology is the study of drugs and their effects on living creatures.</p>
427	82	Toxicology	1	<p>Toxicology is the study of the adverse effects certain chemicals have on living creatures.</p>
428	83	Studious	1	<p>Your mind is a fortress of information that can rarely be breached. You gain a +1 bonus to Will saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 8th level, and +4 at 16th level. You also gain a +1 insight bonus to Life Science, Medicine, and Physical Science checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level, and every 4 levels thereafter. Additionally, you can add your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to Perception and Sense Motive checks.</p>
429	83	Instinctive	1	<p>You can quickly intuit the connections between things and often act instinctively on those connections, gaining knowledge and aptitude without always being able to say how you picked it up. Select two skills&mdash;once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain a bonus rank in each of these two skills at every level, as well as a +1 insight bonus to checks using these skills. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. Additionally, you can add your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier to Life Science, Medicine, and Physical Science checks.</p>
430	93	Aspect Insight	1	<p>Your understanding of a specific aspect of entropy gives you insight into combat and one specific skill that others rarely understand. You gain the Improved Combat Maneuver feat for the listed combat maneuver. Additionally, you gain a +2 insight bonus to checks with one skill determined by your aspect.</p>
431	93	Aspect Embodiment	4	<p>Your understanding of a specific aspect of entropy gives you insight into combat and one specific skill that others rarely understand. You gain the Improved Combat Maneuver feat for the listed combat maneuver. Additionally, you gain a +2 insight bonus to checks with one skill determined by your aspect.</p>
432	93	Aspect Catalyst	12	<p>You have learned to create significant effects under certain conditions, guiding powerful forces with your subconscious mind. You gain an ability that you can use as a reaction the first time you take a critical hit in combat, or as a standard action by expending 4 Entropy Points. You can&rsquo;t use the ability again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.<br />You also gain an improved version of the ability that you can use without taking an action the first time you reach 0 Stamina Points or 0 Hit Points in a combat encounter, expending all Entropy Points you have, if any. Once you use the improved version of the ability, you can&rsquo;t do so again for 24 hours.</p>
433	93	Aspect Finale	18	<p>You gain a powerful ability unique to your aspect.</p>
434	100	Second Aspect Insight	8	<p>You gain the aspect insight benefit from your second vanguard aspect. If you already have the bonus feat granted by this aspect insight, you can instead select any other feat for which you meet the prerequisites.</p>
435	100	Second Aspect Embodiment	17	<p>You gain the aspect embodiment benefit of the second vanguard aspect you selected at 8th level.</p>
436	117	Experimental Armor Prototype	1	<p>You have designed and built a sophisticated suit of armor, which you are constantly optimizing and upgrading with the latest technological breakthroughs. You begin play with one suit of armor with an item level of 1 for free, or you can buy any armor normally and designate it as your armor prototype. You design and build this armor and, while it may be similar in aesthetics and function to an existing type of armor, it is fundamentally unique from any mass-produced product. Due to its experimental design and custom fitting, you are the only one who can benefit from wearing this armor. As you gain levels, your armor prototype advances in sophistication. If you acquire a different suit of armor, you can disassemble your existing prototype and turn the new armor into your prototype with 8 hours of work.<br />Your armor prototype works as normal for a suit of its type, but it also gains specific benefits based on your mechanic level, as defined below. You can have only one suit of armor designated as your armor prototype at a time.</p>
437	117	Experimental Weapon Prototype	1	<p>You have designed and built, and are constantly upgrading, a sophisticated weapon. You begin play with one weapon with an item level of 1 for free, or you can buy any weapon normally and designated it as your weapon prototype. You design and build this weapon and, while it may be similar in aesthetics and function to an existing type of weapon, it is fundamentally unique from any mass-produced product. Due to its experimental design and custom safety features, you are the only one who can make attacks with this weapon. As you gain levels, your weapon prototype advances in sophistication. If you acquire a different weapon, you can disassemble your existing prototype and turn the new weapon into your prototype with 8 hours of work.<br />Your weapon prototype works as normal for a weapon of its type, but it gains specific benefits based on your mechanic level, as defined below. You can have only one weapon designated as your weapon prototype at a time.</p>
438	118	Empowered Healing Touch (SU)	1	<p>You can use your healing touch class feature as a standard action. You can also use healing touch more often by spending 1 Resolve Point each time you use healing touch after the first use each day. You must have the healing touch class feature to learn this epiphany.</p>
439	118	Overbearing Stare (SU)	1	<p>Each day when you regain Stamina Points and daily-use abilities following an 8-hour rest (Core Rulebook 263), choose one of the following: AC, attack rolls, Fortitude saves, Reflex saves, or Will saves. You can focus your gaze on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, bringing down upon it the full might of unseen spirits associated with your connection. The target must succeed at a Will save or take a –1 penalty to the chosen statistic. You can maintain this effect against only one opponent at a time, and it remains in effect until you stare at a new target, the opponent moves more than 30 feet away from you, or either you or the opponent fall unconscious or dies. The penalties of multiple overbearing stares don’t stack. Once you have used this ability against a target, you can’t do so again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, sense-dependent curse effect.</p>
440	118	Solar Connection (SU)	1	<p>You have forged a connection to the powers of the cosmos, drawing upon a link to photons and gravity to forge a weapon made from the primal stuff of the universe. You gain a solar weapon, as the solar manifestation ability of a solarian with a class level equal to your mystic level. If you have levels in both classes, you add them together to determine the effectiveness of your solar weapon. You do not gain any other solar-weapon focused solarian abilities from mystic class levels.</p>
441	118	Wrecking Fists (SU)	1	<p>You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat, and your unarmed strikes don’t count as archaic weapons. Whenever you attack an opponent with your unarmed strikes as a standard action (or a full attack as a full action), as part of that action you can expend a 1st-level or higher spell slot before attempting the first attack roll to deal additional damage. If that attack hits, you deal an additional 2d6 damage per level of the spell slot expended, of the same damage type as your unarmed strike.</p>
442	118	Expanded Skill Channeling (EX)	3	<p>Choose two skills other than your connection’s associated skills. You add the insight bonus granted by the channel skill class feature to skill checks attempted with the chosen skills. In addition, you add your connection’s associated skills and any skills chosen with this epiphany to your list of class skills.</p>
443	118	Secondary Connection	3	<p>Choose a second connection. If you worship a deity, your second connection must be one associated with that deity. You gain the 1st-level connection power from the chosen connection. You don’t gain any additional connection powers from that connection, nor do you gain an insight bonus to skill checks attempted with the second connection’s associated skills from your channel skill ability.</p>
444	118	Improved Secondary Connection	6	<p>You gain the 3rd-level connection power from your secondary connection. You must have the secondary connection epiphany to choose this epiphany.</p>
445	118	Mystic Reach (SU)	6	<p>You can alter a mystic spell’s range by casting it as a full action instead of its normal casting time. Touch spells become close-range spells (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels), close-range spells become medium-range spells (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), mediumrange spells become long-range spells (400 ft. + 40 ft./level), and long-range spells have their range doubled. You can’t use this ability to alter a mystic spell with a casting time of a full action or longer. You can use this ability once per day at no cost, but you must spend 1 Resolve Point each time you use it after the first in a single day.</p>
446	118	Wrecking Spells (SU)	6	<p>When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage, you can increase the spell’s damage by an amount equal to half your mystic level. This increased damage applies to all creatures damaged by an area spell, but for spells that target multiple creatures with multiple rays or other attacks, the increased damage applies only to a single ray or missile. This increased damage doesn’t apply to ongoing damage from the spell (such as bleed or burn damage). This epiphany doesn’t increase ability damage or other spell effects, only damage to Stamina Points or Hit Points.</p>
447	118	Farsight (SP)	9	<p>You gain a divination reservoir. Each day when you regain your mystic spells, your divination reservoir fills with a number of points equal to half your mystic level. Any points from the previous day are lost. You can cast clairaudience/clairvoyance as a spell-like ability by spending 1 point from your divination reservoir, or arcane eye by spending 2 points from your divination reservoir. By spending 4 points from your arcane reservoir, you can combine these effects, allowing you to create an invisible magical sensor (as arcane eye) at any location you’re familiar with at a planetary range.</p>
448	118	Mind Probe (SP)	9	<p>You can cast mind probe as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your mystic level. Once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>
449	118	Spell Bond (SU)	9	<p>When you cast a harmless spell with a range of touch, you can target any ally within 120 feet and linked by your telepathic bond class feature as if you were touching that ally. You must have the telepathic bond class feature to choose this epiphany.</p>
450	118	Greater Secondary Connection	12	<p>You gain the 6th-level connection power from your secondary connection. You must have the secondary connection epiphany and the improved secondary connection epiphany to choose this epiphany.</p>
451	118	Lingering Spell (EX)	12	<p>When you cast a spell with a duration of longer than 1 round, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to double its duration. If the spell is one of your connection spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or longer, its duration increases to 24 hours instead. You can have only one spell affected by this epiphany at a time, and using this ability while another spell is already in effect causes that previous spell to immediately end as if its duration had expired.</p>
452	118	Mindlink Bond (SU)	12	<p>You can combine your mindlink and telepathic bond class features, allowing you to rapidly transfer memories between bonded creatures at great distances. Once per round, any creature belonging to a telepathic bond that you created with your telepathic bond class feature can instantly transfer complex information to any other creatures within the telepathic bond, as the mindlink spell, as a swift action. Each time this ability is used, the creature chooses which creatures belonging to your telepathic bond receive this information.<br />You must have the mindlink and telepathic bond class features to choose this epiphany.</p>
453	118	Guided Reincarnation (SU)	15	<p>Once per day, you can cast reincarnate as a spell-like ability by spending all your remaining Resolve Points (minimum one-quarter your total Resolve Points). Instead of rolling to determine what type of creature the target returns as, the target returns as the race, gender, sex, and physical appearance of their choice. Rather than be a conscious choice of the target, this decision tends to reflect the innermost dreams and desires of the target&rsquo;s soul, and so the reincarnation can be either identical to their previous form or a drastic departure, depending upon the individual.<br />Unlike the spell reincarnate, this ability does not require a monument as part of the casting. Instead, both you and your target gain 2 permanent negative levels (as described by the spell). The target returns to life as an infant of their race, growing from infancy to young adulthood over the course of 1 hour. The target has memories of their original life, but also of a new life that could have existed if they had lived in their new form. In addition to having a new race, the character can be rewritten as if they had used a mnemonic editor.</p>
454	118	Modify Memory (SP)	15	<p>You can use modify memory as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your mystic level. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours. When a target fails its saving throw against this spell, you can spend up to 3 Resolve Points. If you spend 1 Resolve Point, all changes you make to the target’s memory are instantaneous and require no additional rounds of concentration. If you spend 2 Resolve Points, you can change up to 24 hours of memories per mystic level you have. If you spend 3 Resolve Points, you can change up to 1 year of memories per mystic level you have.</p>

463	127	Advanced Coordination (Ex; Coordinated Shot)	3	<p>When you are threatening a foe with a wielded melee weapon, cover it gains from you doesn&rsquo;t grant it any bonus to AC against your allies&rsquo; ranged attacks. The foe still counts as having cover for the purpose of effects such as the Coordinated Shot feat; it simply doesn&rsquo;t gain any cover bonuses to AC against your allies&rsquo; attacks.</p>
464	127	Beatdown (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Trip])	3	<p>Whenever a prone opponent that you threaten attempts to stand up from prone, as a reaction you can make a melee attack against that opponent. This functions similarly to an attack of opportunity, except your attack resolves before&nbsp;the opponent&rsquo;s action (meaning they&rsquo;re still prone when your attack roll and damage are resolved). You cannot use this attack to make a combat maneuver, even if you have another ability or item that would normally allow you to do so.</p>
465	127	Bodyguard Vigilance (Ex; Bodyguard)	3	<p>When you use the Bodyguard feat, it requires no action, but you must spend 1 Resolve Point each time after the first you use the Bodyguard feat during a single round, and each use must designate a different ally. Multiple uses of the Bodyguard feat don&rsquo;t increase the penalty to Armor Class that you take using this feat. If you also have In Harm&rsquo;s Way, each round you can use that feat to intercept one attack per target whose AC you have increased with the Bodyguard feat.</p>
466	127	Chokehold (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple])	3	<p>Whenever you have an opponent pinned, that foe can’t speak or perform actions that involve speaking or uttering sound using their voice (such as roaring, singing, and so on). Normally this prevents the target from using language dependent abilities unless they have limited telepathy or a similar ability.</p>
467	127	Defensive Cleave (Ex; Cleave)	3	<p>When you use the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you don’t take that feat’s penalty to your Armor Class.</p>
468	127	Defensive Lunge (Ex; Lunge)	3	<p>When you use the Lunge feat, you don’t take that feat’s penalty to your Armor Class.</p>
469	127	Grabbing Strike (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple])	11	<p>Whenever you attack an opponent with an unarmed strike and the result of your attack roll exceeds the foe’s KAC by 8 or more, that foe gains the grappled condition as if you had successfully attempted a grapple combat maneuver. You must be at least 11th level to select this feat boost.</p>
470	127	Grapple Equipment (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Grapple])	3	<p>Whenever you succeed at an attack roll to grapple an opponent, you can remove one item from the target’s body that can be easily accessed, as described by the grapple combat maneuver (Core Rulebook 246), instead of imposing the grappled condition on your foe.</p>
471	127	Lightning Kip-Up (Ex; Kip-Up)	3	<p>Whenever you have at least 1 Resolve Point, you can stand from prone as part of any other action you take. Creatures with the moxie racial trait can select this feat boost even if they do not have the Kip Up feat.</p>
472	127	Multi-Weapon Strike (Ex; Multi-Weapon Fighting)	3	<p>As a standard action, you can make two attacks against a single foe, taking a –3 penalty to each attack. Both attacks must be made using small arms or operative melee weapons. If both attacks hit and deal the same type of damage, combine the damage and apply damage reduction, resistances, vulnerabilities, and similar effects only once.</p>
473	127	Multi-Weapon Versatility (Ex; Multi-Weapon Fighting)	3	<p>You treat all one-handed melee weapons as if they had the operative special property for the purpose of determining whether they benefit from the Multi-Weapon Fighting feat and any other combat feats and feat boosts that list Multi-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite.</p>
474	127	Sliding Disarm (Ex; Improved Combat Maneuver [Disarm])	3	<p>Whenever you successfully use the disarm combat maneuver against an opponent, you can knock the disarmed item up to 10 feet away from the opponent in a direction of your choice.</p>
475	127	Soldier’s Adaptability (Ex; Adaptive Fighting)	3	<p>You can use the Adaptive Fighting feat multiple times per day. Each time per day you use Adaptive Fighting after the first, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use Adaptive Fighting again before a previous use expires, you replace the previously chosen feat with a different choice. If a combat feat has any daily, encounter, or target limitations, any uses of any feat chosen with this ability count toward its daily limit.</p>
476	127	Spinning Cleave (Ex; Cleave)	3	<p>Whenever you use the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you can make subsequent attacks against foes that are not adjacent to one another, provided each foe is within your reach.</p>
477	127	Springing Onslaught (Ex; Spring Attack)	7	<p>When you use Spring Attack, you can select two targets to attack during your movement instead of one. Both attacks are made with a –4 penalty. All restrictions of Spring Attack apply to both targets, and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either target. You can’t target the same creature twice with this ability. You must be at least 7th level to select this feat boost.</p>
478	127	Springing Shot (Ex; Shot on the Run)	7	<p>When you use Shot on the Run, you can select two targets to attack during your movement instead of one. Both attacks take a –4 penalty. All restrictions of Shot on the Run apply to both targets, and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either target. You can’t target the same creature twice with this ability. You must be at least 7th level to select this feat boost.</p>
479	127	Volleying Bombardment (Ex; Opening Volley)	3	<p>Whenever you deal damage to an opponent with a ranged attack on your second or subsequent turn in a combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next melee attack against that opponent, so long as this melee attack occurs before the end of your next turn.</p>
480	128	Advanced Operations Specialist (Ex)	3	<p>Choose one class skill you gained from the soldier class or a soldier class feature. You gain an insight bonus to this skill equal to one-third your soldier class level (minimum +1). You can select this special ops training more than once. Each time, you select a different class skill.</p>
481	128	Operations Specialist (Ex)	3	<p>Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Computers, Disguise, Perception, Piloting, or Stealth. Add the chosen skill to your list of soldier class skills, and gain a +1 bonus to checks with this skill. You can select this special ops training more than once. Each time, you select a different class skill.</p>
