1	Envoy	<p>The envoy uses her personal magnetism and intelligence to help her allies and baffle her enemies, often in the service of negotiation or politics.</p>	<p>You make your way in the universe with a charming smile, quick wit, and keen sense of self-preservation, and excel at getting others to do what you want. You might be a trickster, hustler, or con artist, or you might serve as an actor, ambassador, or businessperson, paving the way for negotiation through kind words or the occasional dirty trick. You are often the group&rsquo;s strategist, using your quick wit and tactical acumen to push your friends to greater heights. You may also be skilled in diplomacy, serving as the face for a starship crew, talking your way into restricted systems or gaining audiences with local politicians or warlords.</p>	6	6	Your Charisma helps you succeed in many social situations and makes a number of your improvisations more effective, so Charisma is your key ability score. A high Dexterity score can make you a better ranged combatant, while a high Intelligence score improves all of your skills.	Charisma	8	CRB	60
2	Mechanic	<p>Adept at building and modifying machinery, the mechanic has either an advanced artificial intelligence or a cutting-edge robot drone as his constant companion.</p>	<p>You are a master of machines, from advanced supercomputers to simple magnetic engines. Understanding how these devices work gives you insight into the world around you, allowing you to make the most of your gear, circumvent hardened defenses, and even take over remote systems. Your programming skill also gives you the ability to create a powerful ally, in the form of either an implanted artificial intelligence or a robotic drone, which can assist you with a variety of tasks. If there&rsquo;s a computer or machine that needs to be fixed, bypassed, or destroyed, you&rsquo;re the first on the scene. Whether you&rsquo;re a skilled scientist, a starship engineer, or a battlefield technician, you&rsquo;re no stranger to combat&mdash;but you find it much more reasonable to have your AI or drone do the fighting for you.</p>	6	6	You rely on your Intelligence for your knowledge, skills, and technical know-how, so Intelligence is your key ability score. A high Dexterity score makes your ranged attacks more accurate, should you engage in combat.	Intelligence	4	CRB	68
3	Mystic	<p>The mystic magically channels the energy connecting all things, often through a focus on the divine or intuitive understanding of biological systems.</p>	<p>You understand that what most people call magic is simply an expression of the innate connection between all things, and you intuitively tap into this unseen power to create strange effects. You may conceptualize the source of your magic as divine grace, a manipulation of fundamental energy, or an unlocking of psychic potential, but always with the knowledge that you are a conduit channeling forces greater than yourself. Though you may study, you understand that spellcasting&mdash;like all existence&mdash;is messy and intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be perfectly understood by science. You sense the intangible and exploit your bonds with others, whether to bolster them or bend them to your will.</p>	6	6	Your Wisdom determines your spellcasting ability, the saving throw DCs of your spells, and the number of bonus spells you can cast per day, so Wisdom is your key ability score. A high Charisma score can also help you in social situations.	Wisdom	6	CRB	82
4	Operative	<p>The operative has the skills to complete almost any mission requiring stealth and discretion, whether it be simple espionage or messy wet work.</p>	<p>You&rsquo;re a shadow. You move swiftly, strike suddenly, and always have an escape plan. You&rsquo;re a consummate professional, and you always get the job done, whether it&rsquo;s scouting enemy lines, hunting down criminals, stealing and smuggling items, or assassinating key figures. As an operative, you're skilled in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and use speed, mobility, and your quick wits rather than relying on heavy weapons. You excel at the art of surprise, whether it&rsquo;s sniping targets from cover or striking while their backs are turned. Your cause may be righteous, but you have no problem fighting dirty&mdash;achieving your objective is all that matters.</p>	6	6	Your Dexterity helps you to infiltrate, get into position, escape danger, and make decisive shots with your weapon, so Dexterity is your key ability score. High Intelligence boosts your skills, and Charisma aids in your interactions with other characters.	Dexterity	8	CRB	92
5	Solarian	<p>The solarian contemplates and gains power from the life cycles of stars. His techniques allow him to create a weapon or suit of armor from a mote of stellar energy.</p>	<p>The stars guide the planets with gravity, create life with light and heat, and utterly consume worlds in supernovas and black holes. You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites, but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as part of an ancient tradition&mdash;a force of preservation and annihilation.</p>	7	7	Your Charisma lets you channel your connection to the cosmos, so Charisma is your key ability score. A high Strength score can make you better at melee attacks.	Charisma	4	CRB	100
6	Soldier	<p>Thoroughly familiar with weapons of war, the soldier is ready to wreak havoc when force is called for, and specializes in a particular fighting style.</p>	<p>Conflict is an inevitable result of life. On every world that harbors complex living organisms, creatures battle one another for dominance, resources, territory, or ideals. Whether you&rsquo;ve taken up arms to protect others, win glory, exact revenge, or simply earn a living, you are the perfect embodiment of this truth. You&rsquo;re an expert at combat of all types but tend to prefer heavy armor and weapons&mdash;the bigger, the better. You may be a career soldier, a fresh mercenary recruit, or a lone wolf who rejects authority, but whether rushing in for hand-to-hand combat or firing tactical barrages, you&rsquo;re a consummate warrior, never hesitating to put yourself in the line of fire to protect your friends.</p>	7	7	Your Strength helps you attack up close in melee and carry heavier weapons and armor, while your Dexterity helps you fire weapons from a distance and dodge returning fire, so you should choose either Strength or Dexterity as your key ability score. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. A high Constitution score allows you to soak up more damage.	Strength or Dexterity	4	CRB	110
7	Technomancer	<p>The technomancer understands the connections between technology and magic, and exploits them by bending reality to suit her needs.</p>	<p>To the uninitiated, magic and technology are completely unrelated, but you know there are more correlations between the two than most suspect. Magic and technology are just tools, and when combined into one discipline, called technomancy, they can be far more powerful than one or the other on its own. You utilize tech to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you wield magic to augment, control, and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of the universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will. Your technomancy&mdash;which is gained from scientific study and experimentation&mdash;manipulates the physical world, weaves illusions, allows you to peer through time and space, and if necessary, can blast a foe into atoms.</p>	5	5	Your Intelligence determines your spellcasting ability, the saving throw DCs of your spells, and the number of bonus spells you can cast per day, so Intelligence is your key ability score. Also, a high Dexterity score can help you fire your weapons more accurately and dodge incoming attacks.	Intelligence	4	CRB	118
8	Biohacker	<p>The biohacker uses complex catalysts and fringe medical knowledge to augment her allies and inhibit her foes, often using injection weapons.</p>	<p>You&rsquo;re fascinated by science in all its many facets. You understand that the fundamentals of biology, chemistry, physics, and other disciplines can help you exploit your enemies&rsquo; weaknesses and bolster your allies. You might be studious and methodical about your research, pushing your mind to the limit in search of discovery, or you might be a daring experimenter, improvising concoctions and stumbling upon grand revelations. Either way, you use your knowledge of several fields of scientific study to aid your allies, whether in the thick of battle or in crafting a perfect plan.</p>	6	6	Your Intelligence helps you learn about the sciences, while your Wisdom helps you interpret facts and apply them to real-world situations. You should choose either Intelligence or Wisdom as your key ability score. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. A high Dexterity can help you better aid your allies and hinder your foes with your ranged biohacks.	Intelligence	4	COM	40
9	Vanguard	<p>An expert at close combat, the vanguard has gained supernatural control over the power of entropy, and can speed, slow, or alter how energies and reactions occur.</p>	<p>Change and decay are the only universal constants, and your understanding of these principles makes you a nigh-unstoppable force of nature: a juggernaut brimming with fundamental energies that allow you to hold the front line of any conflict and turn your own injuries into strength. The entropy within the universe and the level of chaos within any system stand at your disposal, and you channel them into potent combat abilities. To you, the inevitable decay of the galaxy is simply a force to shape, control, and even temporarily reverse. The ability to control when and how things change defines your philosophy and power, allowing you to transform blows that should have destroyed you into ticking time bombs of destruction ready to be unleashed upon your enemies.</p>	7	7	Your Constitution determines your ability to control matter at an atomic level, the DCs of your abilities, the damage dealt by your entropic strike, and your general hardiness, so Constitution is your key ability score. A high Dexterity helps you act early in combat, avoid damage when you need to, and successfully land blows with your entropic strike.	Constitution	6	COM	50
10	Witchwarper	<p>Witchwarpers are powerful spellcasters who draw their magic from alternate realities and can pull bubbles of those realities into their current space.</p>	<p>Most people believe that reality is limited to their physical surroundings. You know the truth: that everything around you is merely a thin veil draped across the infinite tapestry of existence. Your reality is a palimpsest, with all possible worlds and all alternate existences at your disposal. Through your magic and force of personality, you can peer into these time lines and pull from them as you see fit, using their dimensional echoes to twist and reshape your own world.</p>	5	5	Your Charisma score determines your spellcasting ability, the saving throw DCs of your spells, and the number of bonus spells you can cast per day, so Charisma is your key ability score. A high Dexterity score can help you fire weapons more accurately and dodge incoming attacks.	Charisma	4	COM	60
