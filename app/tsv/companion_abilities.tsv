1	sandstorm_breath	<p>Every 1d4 rounds, a draserka can breathe a ball of electrically charged sand as a ranged attack that targets EAC. This attack is a 60-foot cone and has the blast weapon special property.</p>
1	speed_surge	<p>If you are mounted on your draserka companion and it takes two move actions to fly its speed, its fly speed increases to 70 feet for those actions.</p>
2	moral_support	<p>While your empathnid companion is sharing your space, you gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against emotion and pain effects.</p>
2	stabilizing_venom	<p>Once per day as a standard action, an empathnid can inject its venom into a dying creature in its space, automatically stabilizing that creature. If you are dying, your empathnid companion can use actions as though you were consciously directing it, but only to attempt to stabilize you.</p>
3	lie_in_wait	<p>While mounted on your eshar companion, you can remain burrowed in sand or loose dirt for up to 1 hour, and if combat begins during this time, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to any skill check (normally Perception or Stealth) to determine whether you act in a surprise round.</p>
3	screech	<p>As a standard action, an eshar can unleash a terrifying screech, causing each creature within 30 feet to become shaken for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the eshar’s level). Regardless of whether a creature succeeds at this check, it is immune to that eshar’s screech for 24 hours. Eshars are immune to the screech ability of other eshars, and you are immune to the screech of your own eshar companion.</p>
4	body_slam	<p>When you are mounted on your pachycephalosaurid companion and it takes the charge action, it doesn’t take the normal charge penalties to the attack roll or its AC, and it can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver at the end of its movement instead of its normal attack, with a +4 circumstance bonus to the bull rush attempt. The pachycephalosaurid can also add its Strength modifier to this bull rush attempt.</p>
4	headbutt	<p>When you are mounted on your pachycephalosaurid companion and a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from it, your companion can lower its powerful head and execute a headbutt as a reaction. This headbutt is a melee attack that targets the foe’s KAC and deals bludgeoning damage. If the headbutt hits, add twice your companion’s Strength modifier to the damage dealt (instead of just its Strength modifier).</p>
5	convincing_accessory	<p>While your proog companion is in your space and not moving, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Disguise checks if an inanimate object would help your disguise.</p>
5	mimic	<p>A proog can look like any solid object of 1 bulk or less that it comes in contact with. It can’t imitate such an item’s function, moving parts, or the like. A creature that closely examines a mimicking proog can determine its true nature with a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the proog’s level).</p>
6	jungle_strider	<p>Shotalashus are adept at traversing all forms of forest terrain. While in forest terrain, a shotalashu’s speed is not impeded by natural difficult terrain such as undergrowth.</p>
6	telepathic_companion	<p>If you have limited telepathy or telepathy, you can control your shotalashu companion in combat even if it can’t see or hear you, as long as it is within range of your telepathy.</p>
6	telepathic_link	<p>If you are a lashunta, you can spend 1 hour and attempt a Survival check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the shotalashu’s level) to form a telepathic bond with your shotalashu companion. On a success, your link functions as telepathic bond with a permanent duration, and the shotalashu is considered a combat-trained mount when carrying or fighting alongside you. You can’t be linked to more than one shotalashu at a time, but you can break your link with one shotalashu in favor of another at any time. If either you or your linked shotalashu dies while bonded, the surviving creature suffers telepathic backlash, becoming dazed for 1 round and taking 3d6 damage. If you are not a lashunta but have limited telepathy or telepathy and speak Lashunta, you can also attempt to forge this telepathic bond, but you take a –5 penalty to the Survival checks to do so.</p>
7	diverting_coat	<p>If your tashtari companion is within 30 feet of you at the beginning of your turn, you can attempt a new saving throw against any fascination effects currently affecting you without taking an action. If the new saving throw is successful, the fascination effect ends. This has no effect on abilities that do not allow saving throws.</p>
7	muzzle_beam	<p>Every 1d4 rounds, a tashtari can unleash a focused ray of light as a ranged attack that targets EAC. This ray has a range increment of 80 feet and the burn critical hit effect.</p>
8	death_dive	<p>If your thakasa companion is flying at the start of your turn, it can take the charge full action using its fly speed, provided that at least 10 feet of its movement is in a downward direction.</p>
8	midair_rescue	<p>If you fall off your thakasa companion while at least 30 feet above the ground, it automatically dives to catch you as a reaction, if able. If it catches you, you are mounted but gain the prone condition. You can use the stand up move action to lose the prone condition.</p>
9	magical_transference	<p>Once per day while you have line of effect and line of sight to your vorac companion and it is within 30 feet of you and in an empty square, you can cast a spell as though you were in the vorac’s space instead of your own.</p>
9	spellcaster’s_apprentice	<p>While your vorac companion is adjacent to or sharing your space, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Mysticism checks to disable a magic device and to identify and repair magic or hybrid items.</p>
10	snow_stride	<p>A wolliped treats heavy snow as difficult terrain, and snow as normal terrain.</p>
10	spit	<p>Once per hour as a standard action, a wolliped can regurgitate, spitting this vomit as a ranged attack (targeting EAC) at a target within 10 feet. On a hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the wolliped’s level + the wolliped’s Strength modifier) or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.</p>
10	warming_presence	<p>While mounted on or adjacent to your wolliped companion, you treat severe cold as cold and extreme cold as severe cold.</p>
11	agile_mount	<p>While mounted on your yasakaja companion, reduce the DC of Survival checks to fast mount or dismount, leap, or spur mount by an amount equal to the yasakaja’s level (to a minimum of 0).</p>
11	mandibles	<p>When a yasakaja scores a critical hit against a living creature with its mandibles attack, the naturally occurring acid in its saliva seeps into the wound, imposing the corrode (1d4) critical hit effect. A 10th- to 14th-level yasakaja’s corrode deals 2d4 damage, and a 15th-level or higher yasakaja’s corrode deals 4d4 damage. This is a poison effect.</p>
