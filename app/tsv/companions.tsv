Dreserka	<p>Often called “desert drakes,” draserkas are draconic creatures native to the side of Verces known as Fullbright, where the sun never sets, the earth is scorched, and the air is always superheated. These red drakes with blue wings are infamous for breathing balls of crackling electricity at foes, and they can fly at incredible speeds when they’ve built up their momentum.</p>	7	20	10	10	large	dragon	30	null	60	20	blindsense (vibration and scent) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision	Fort	Ref, Will	bite (P)	sandstorm breath (E)	Str, Con	AA3	143
Empathnid	<p>Originally discovered by Pact Worlds explorers on a jungle planet in the Vast, empathnids are available in a staggering array of colors and have become popular pets. The 8-inch spiders are most notable for their almost supernatural empathy for other creatures, and their venom has a stabilizing effect on most creatures.</p>	1	10	1	0	dimunitive	vermin	40	40	null	nul	blindsense (emotion) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft.

Eshar	<p>Eshars are hulking, serpentine beasts from the expansive, sandy deserts of the tidally locked planet Verces. They are used for battle, transportation, and even for sport, in an elaborate zone-capturing game that can last for days.</p>	10	20	15	10	huge	animal	40	null	null	60	blindsight (vibration) 60 ft., low-light vision	Fort	Ref, Will	tail (B)	null	Con, Dex	AA3	144
Pachycephalosaurid	<p>Pachycephalosaurids are bipedal dinosaurs with thick, domed skulls that can withstand incredible impacts—and be quite dangerous to creatures on the other end of their headbutts. A low center of gravity and wicked talons make pachycephalosaurids popular beasts of burden as well as combat-trained mounts.</p>	3	20	10	10	large	animal	40	null	null	null	blindsense (scent) 60 ft., low-light vision	Fort	Ref, Will	talons (S)	null	Str, Con	AA3	144
Proog	<p>Proogs are highly active shape- and color-shifting oozes that enjoy mimicking small objects; they’re most commonly bred as novelty pets. Xenobiologists disagree on how the oozes manage to so accurately duplicate details like color and pattern without sight. Proogs tend to imprint on a single larger creature, and while naturally curious, they rarely stray farther from their owner than the range of their blindsight.</p>	1	5	2.5	0	tiny	ooze	20	null	null	null	blindsight (life) 60 ft., sightless	Fort	Ref, Will	pseudopod (B)	null	Con, Wis	AA3	144
Shotalashu	<p>While shotalashus have served as the traditional mounts of Castrovel’s lashuntas for millennia, many other species forge deep connections with the creatures—especially those with telepathic abilities.</p>	1	20	10	5	large	magical beast	60	null	null	null	darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision	Ref	Fort, Will	claws (S)	null	Dex, Con	AA3	145
Tashtari	<p>Nicknamed “laser wolves,” tashtaris are covered in a twinkling phosphorescent coat that they can use to communicate and power their muzzle beams. Domesticated tashtaris are less dangerous than their wild counterparts, but they can still be potent threats on the battlefield.</p>	4	20	5	5	medium	magical beast	30	30	null	null	darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision	Ref	Fort, Will	bite (P)	muzzle beam (F; critical burn 1d4)	Dex, Str	AA3	145
Thakasa	<p>Thakasas are close evolutionary relatives of Castrovel’s shotalashus. Long before the Gap, they were the chosen mount of an aerial cavalry, but with the proliferation of flying vehicles, they have become much rarer.</p>	13	20	10	5	large	magical beast	30	null	60	null	darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision	Ref	Fort, Will	talons (P)	null	Dex, Str	AA3	146
Vorac	<p>Voracs are eyeless, six-winged, crow-like creatures common to forested areas on several of Bretheda’s moons. They travel in large flocks in the wild, singing low and haunting songs punctuated by the crackling of raw magical energy.</p>	5	12	2.5	0	tiny	magical beast	10	null	30	null	blindsight (thought) 60 ft.; sightless	Will	Fort, Ref	talon (S)	null	Wis, Cha	AA3	146

Yasakaja	<p>Native to the jungles of the isolated continent of Ukulam on Castrovel, yasakajas are furred quadrupeds with four eyes, a fox-like tail, and enormous, insectile mandibles. Yasakajas are known for being sturdy mounts with great endurance and superb mobility.</p>	1	20	5	5	large	animal	50	30	null	null	blindsense (vibration) 60 ft.
