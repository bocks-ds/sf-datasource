1	Adaptive Fighting	Three or more combat feats	Once per day as a move action, gain the benefit of a combat feat you don't have/	<p>Select three combat feats that you do not have but whose prerequisites you meet. Once per day as a move action, you can gain the benefit of one of these feats for 1 minute. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one of these three selected feats with a different feat that you don't have but meet the prerequisites for.</p>|	yes	CRB	154
2	Add Leverage	Str 15	Grip your weapon with more hands to move foes farther with combat maneuvers	<p>For each hand you use to wield your weapon beyond the minimum required to wield that weapon, you increase the distance you can move your opponent with a successful bull rush or reposition combat maneuver by 5 feet. If you use a trip combat maneuver against a flying opponent, you can increase the distance that creature descends by 5 feet for each additional hand used to wield your weapon. Changing your grip to alter the number of hands you are wielding a weapon with is a swift action. You can’t hold items in hands used to add leverage, or use them for any other purpose.</p>|	yes	COM	112
3	Advance Warning	Cha 15	Shout a warning to your allies, causing them to stop being flat-footed	<p>As a move action, you can shout a warning to your allies, ending the flat-footed condition for any ally within 60 feet. You cannot use this feat when you’re flat-footed. Once you’ve used this ability, you cannot do so again until you’ve regained Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest. This is a sense-dependent ability.</p>|	yes	COM	112
4	Advanced Melee Weapon Proficiency	Proficiency in basic melee weapons	No penalty to attacks with advanced melee weapons	<p>You gain proficiency in advanced melee weapons.</p>|	yes	CRB	154

6	Ambush Awareness	null	If you fail the Perception check to act in the surprise round, you can still take a full defense action	<p>If you are unable to act in the surprise round because you failed a Perception check, you can still act on your initiative count in the surprise round, but only to take the total defense action.</p>|	yes	COM	112
7	Amplified Glitch	Computers 3 ranks, Intimidate 3 ranks	Disrupt devices, causing targets to become shaken for 1 round or more	<p>As a standard action, you can wirelessly introduce a fast-acting virus into nearby technological devices to briefly cause them to malfunction in loud, surprising ways. You can use this ability on one target creature per character level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. Each target must either be carrying technological devices or be within sight and hearing of such devices. While the locations of such devices are up to the GM, most public spaces (aside from technologically underdeveloped areas) contain enough technology for this feat to function. Your glitch causes alarms to go off, automated devices to spin and flail, readouts to flash brightly, and so on. With a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 x the CR of the highest-CR target), all targets are shaken for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC.<br/>Once you have targeted a creature with this feat, that foe is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>|	yes	CRB	155
8	Barricade	Engineering 1 rank	Create your own fragile cover	<p>As a move action, you can stack and reinforce objects that are too small or too fragile to provide cover into a single square of adjacent cover. The GM has discretion over whether enough such objects are nearby to allow you to use this ability, but most urban and wilderness settings not specifically described as empty or barren have enough such material to allow at least one such temporary barricade to be built. The barricade grants partial cover against attacks with line of effect that pass through it. If the barricade is in a square that already granted partial cover, it instead grants normal cover.<br/> The barricade is temporary and not particularly durable. When determining its hardness and Hit Points, treat it as a piece of equipment with an item level equal to half your total ranks in Engineering (minimum 1st level). Additionally, once it or a creature adjacent to it is hit by an attack, the barricade collapses at the beginning of your turn in 1d4 rounds (unless the barricade is destroyed completely by the attack). There isn’t normally enough material for you to build a second barricade in exactly the same space unless you are in a particularly crowded area (as determined by the GM).</p>|	yes	CRB	155
9	Basic Melee Weapon Proficiency	null	No penalty to attacks with basic melee weapons	<p>You gain proficiency in basic melee weapons.</p>|	yes	CRB	155

You don’t need to attempt Acrobatics checks to move at full speed while blinded.</p>|	yes	CRB	155
11	Blood in Their Eyes	null	Your critical hits with slashing attacks make foes dazzled	<p>When you score a critical hit with a weapon that deals slashing damage, in addition to any other critical hit effect you would normally apply, you also impose the dazzled condition on the target. The condition lasts until ended by any action or effect that would end the bleeding condition.</p>|	yes	COM	113
12	Bodyguard	null	Add a +2 bonus to an adjacent ally’s AC as a reaction	<p>As a reaction when an adjacent ally is attacked, you can grant that ally a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against that attack.

13	Cleave	Str 13, base attack bonus +1	Make an additional melee attack if the first one hits	<p>As a standard action, you can make a single melee attack against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional melee attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can make only one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a –2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.</p>|	yes	CRB	155
14	Close Combat	Base attack bonus +1	#ERROR!	<p>When you hit an adjacent foe with a melee attack, as long as you are adjacent to that target, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against attacks from other creatures that are not adjacent to you until the beginning of your next turn.</p>|	yes	PWD	190

17	Cook Grenade	Dex 11, proficiency with grenades	Time your release of a grenade to increase its effectiveness	<p>As a full action, you can draw a grenade and make a ranged attack with it. If you do so, the grenade’s Reflex save DC is increased by 2. If your attack roll is a natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1), the grenade instead detonates at a randomly determined grid intersection of your space.</p>|	yes	COM	113
18	Coordinated Shot	Base attack bonus +1	Allies gain a +1 bonus to ranged attacks against foes you threaten	<p>When you are threatening a foe with a melee weapon, any ally that has line of sight to that foe without you granting that foe cover gains a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that foe.</p>|	yes	CRB	156
19	Craven Ploy	Cha 13	Willing ally takes -2 to AC to increase your AC by 2	<p>As a reaction when you are attacked while adjacent to an ally, if that ally is willing to take a -2 penalty to her Armor Class until the beginning of her next turn, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against that attack.</p>|	yes	SS1	52
20	Deadly Aim	Base attack bonus +1	Take a −2 penalty to weapon attacks to deal extra damage	<p>When you take the attack or full attack action with weapons (including a solarian’s solar manifestation, but not spells or other special abilities of any kind), you can take a –2 penalty to your attack rolls. If you do, those attacks deal additional damage equal to half your base attack bonus (minimum 1).</p>|	yes	CRB	156
21	Defensive Roll	Dex 19, Acrobatics 10 ranks	Attempt an Acrobatics check in place of a Reflex save or to dodge an attack	<p>As a reaction when you are attacked or when you must attempt a Reflex saving throw, you can attempt an Acrobatics check. If you use this ability as a reaction to an attack and your Acrobatics check result exceeds your opponent’s attack roll result, the attack misses you. If you use this ability as a reaction when you must attempt a Reflex saving throw, you can use your Acrobatics check result as your Reflex save result. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest. After you use this ability, you are staggered on your next turn.</p>|	yes	COM	113

If your attack roll is higher than the attack roll that hit you, you deflect the attack with your weapon, and it misses. This doesn’t work against area attacks, even against area attacks that have attack rolls like blast weapons, and you can’t use this reaction if you aren’t capable of making an attack with an appropriate weapon.</p>|	yes	CRB	156
24	Dire Straits	Con 15	Stabilize when you have no Hit Points or Resolve Points left	<p>Once per day, when you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and have no Resolve Points remaining, you immediately stabilize.</p>|	yes	COM	113

26	Double Draw	Four or more arms	Your limbs allow you to manipulate multiple weapons.	<p>You can draw, reload, or sheathe two weapons with the same action normally required to do so with one weapon.</p>|	yes	COM	21
27	Double Tap	Weapon Focus (small arms), proficiency with small arms	Expend double the normal ammunition to gain bonuses to attack and damage with a small arm	<p>As a standard action, you can take a single attack action to make a double-tap attack with a small arm. This attack gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll, and your bonus to damage from Weapon Specialization is equal to your character level (rather than half your character level). The small arm used cannot have the blast, explode, flexible line, line, unwieldy, or wide line weapon special properties, or any other property that allows it to attack multiple targets or an area in a single attack. This attack cannot benefit from the boost, guided, or variant boost weapon special properties, or any other ability or effect that is a move action and alters the effect of your attack or damage. This expends ammunition equal to two attack rolls, and if you cannot expend that ammunition, you cannot use this ability.</p>|	yes	COM	114

You suffer the effects of the attack as normal, but as long as you remain able to complete the spellcasting after the attack, you successfully cast the spell.</p>|	yes	PWD	191
32	Fouling Reposition	Improved Combat Maneuver (reposition)	Reposition a foe to throw it and another creature off balance	<p>When you succeed at a reposition combat maneuver against a creature and move your target so it ends its movement adjacent to a second creature, both creatures become off-target until the beginning of your next turn.</p>|	yes	COM	115

You can use this ability on one target creature per character level, all of which must be within range of your telepathy. If you succeed at an Intimidate check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 × the CR of the highest CR target), all targets are shaken for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC.

However, although unaware of your spying, the subject can attempt a saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) to prevent it. Succeeding by 5 or more at this save also alerts the subject to your snooping.</p>|		DF01	44
