1	Fine art	<p>Fine art can be nearly anything, though as trade goods those items with a set, singular, physical existence (paintings, sculpture, and so on) are more easily bought and sold than performance art (though, for example, the sole copy of a famous vesk play could be valuable until broadly disseminated). Fine art can be of nearly any price or bulk, as determined by the GM.</p>	Trade Goods	Varies	Varies	CRB	232
2	Gem	<p>Gems are valued for their scarcity, their beauty, and, in some cases, their utility for some forms of magic rituals and technology. The value of a gemstone is determined by many factors, including size, rarity, clarity, cut, polish, and potential cultural influences. Gems considered of low quality are usually priced at 5–45 credits. Gems rated as semiprecious are generally priced at 50–95 credits. Gems rated as precious are generally priced at 150–450 credits, and those rated as jewels are generally priced at 1,000–4,500 credits. Gems rated as grand jewels are priced no lower than 5,000 credits, and the rarest and most valued can be worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of credits.</p>	Trade Goods	Varies	null	CRB	232

4	Textiles, common	<p>Common textiles include good linen and most synthetic fabrics. Fine textiles are of higher quality, with more visual appeal, higher durability, or both. Various silks, satins, and similar cloths are typical fine textiles, though more exotic materials exist in this category. Truly luxurious fabrics, including marramas and samite, can easily cost much more than even the best fine fabrics.</p>	Trade Goods	1	L	CRB	232

6	UPB (1000)	<p>A universal polymer base, or UPB, is the basis for most technology in the Pact Worlds, the Veskarium, and many other systems. Each UPB is a tiny multifunction component, not much larger than a grain of rice, capable of being configured to act as a brace, capacitor, circuit, diode, fastener, insulator, lens, modulator, pipe, resistor, and dozens of other constituent parts. UPBs can even be spun out into fabric, broken down into component chemicals, reconstituted into new chemicals, or supplemented with base materials (such as dirt or sand) to form massive braces or walls. The right combination of hundreds or even thousands of UPBs can create everything from a comm unit to a laser weapon to powered armor. In their raw form, UPBs have a bulk of 1 per 1,000 UPBs, though when aligned and configured they can easily take up less bulk, and when configured for a specific purpose that calls for a minimum size and bracing (possibly combining them with inert materials), they can have a higher bulk.<br/> UPBs are so ubiquitous that they are usable as currency in many major settlements and trade hubs. While credsticks are a more convenient and secure way to carry value, UPBs have the advantage of direct utility and untraceability. They are a popular way to pay smugglers and criminals, but they are also useful for trade missions to systems with UPB technology that don’t use credits as currency. The value of the Pact Worlds’ credit is based on the economic utility of a single UPB.</p>	Trade Goods	1000	1	CRB	233
7	Common chain	<p>Options for dining out can be divided into two broad categories: chain restaurants and independent venues. Chain restaurants are ubiquitous and tend to be cheaper, but they have less variety and the food is lower quality. Independent venues are more expensive, but they often employ master chefs who create the highest-quality food in all the Pact Worlds. The prices listed in Table 1–33 are averages, and the quality of the restaurant corresponds to the quality of the meals served (Core Rulebook 233). Dining at independent venues with well-known or famous chefs can be even more expensive, with prices equal to the head chef’s total skill bonus in Life Science multiplied by 10.</p>	Food and Drink	10	null	ARM	134

An intoxicant’s potency can be minor or superior. A minor intoxicant might be beer or wine, which takes a few servings to cause any physiological effects. A superior intoxicant is usually a strong spirit, such as whiskey, that can start producing effects after a single serving. Unlike drugs, intoxicants are usually not addictive, although a GM might rule that a PC who partakes of too much of an intoxicant on a regular basis might begin to suffer the effects of an addictive drug (as described in Afflictions on page 417).</p>	Food and Drink	1	L	CRB	233

They cannot fill roles in starship combat, but they can serve on teams supporting an officer in a role.<br/> Officers are NPCs who can be hired to fill unoccupied starship combat roles on a starship. Officer stat blocks can be created using the monster creation rules beginning on page 126 of the Alien Archive, with the skill most associated with their starship role as a master skill. They can be any CR, but few officers will serve on a starship of a lower tier than their CR. Officers can have any class graft, but it’s generally easier to find envoys, mechanics, operatives, and soldiers interested in serving aboard starships than mystics, solarians, or technomancers.<br/> The price of hiring a starship officer is based on the typical total bonus she has in a specific skill relevant to her starship role, representing her skill level. However, the GM can determine that a specific officer actually has a bonus much higher or lower than the norm for someone at her pay rate. At the GM’s discretion, NPCs that the PCs have helped or allied with can choose to become crew members on the PCs’ starship, possibly reducing the price to hire them by half, one-third, or even to zero for exceptionally grateful NPCs.</p>	Professional Services	Skill bonus × 5 per week	null	ARM	135

Such creatures are as varied in size, shape, color, and features as the planets they inhabit. Typically, biological transport is slower and more expensive than automated travel, but in frontier regions, it may be the only option available. Biological transport can be rented on a daily basis, with prices determined by the size of the creature. The listed price does not include the cost of feeding and maintaining the creature. Generally, rented biological transport requires riders to control and direct the creatures, using the ride a creature task of the Survival skill.<br/> Alternatively, you can simply purchase a ride on biological transport, with prices determined by the size of the creature and the distance traveled. For Large or larger creatures, the listed price typically includes a trained handler for that animal who directs it toward your destination.</p>	Transportation	3000 per day	null	ARM	135
