Attablossom	<p>Activating the attablossom is a standard action, causing it to vibrate and hum pleasantly and almost inaudibly, filling a 20-foot-radius spread with a sense of ease. A creature in this area that fails a DC 13 Will saving throw takes a –2 penalty to Perception checks and saving throws against effects that cause sleep. An attablossom operates on its own power for up to 1 hour per day, but any activation uses 10 minutes of this time. The device has a timer allowing it to activate automatically and to time its activation to a specific length.</p>	Hybrid	1	150	L	null	null	null	DF02	14
Dust Goggles (Worn)	<p>These goggles of smoked glass are used by membrane ghibranis of Elytrio to protect their eyes during the frequent dust storms in the wastes of their ravaged planet. When you wear a pair of dust goggles, the penalty to Perception checks from storms is removed and your visibility range isn’t reduced (see Weather on page 398 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook). In addition, you reduce your miss chance due to concealment from smoke and fog (including that produced by a smoke grenade or an effect such as fog cloud) by 10% (to a minimum of 0%); this reduction doesn’t stack with any other ability that reduces miss chance due to concealment.<br/> Dust goggles can also be installed in armor (or an android’s armor upgrade slot) as an armor upgrade. This has no effect on weight or cost, but when installed in this way, they do not count toward a character’s limit of two worn magic or hybrid items at once.</p>	Hybrid	1	120	null	null	null	null	DS05	43
Instant Ground	<p>Exiles on Atachuuva developed instant ground to expand their land. Following the Swarm’s attack on Atachuuva, survivors use instant ground to create patches of land to serve as new homes. Instant ground is water resistant but still somewhat biodegradable as a few of Atachuuva’s oversized insect species have developed a taste for it.<br/> Each container holds a biochemical powder mixed with magically charged particles from the Plane of Earth. When poured into water as a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the components react swiftly to form a stable, buoyant platform in a 5-foot radius, provided the amount of water large enough to allow this expansion. If the body of water is smaller than the resulting ground area, instant ground consumes the available water and fills the available space. Any remaining powder is rendered inert. The landmass is a hemisphere with its dome pointed downward, so the ground is flat and stays upright on rough water.</p>	Hybrid	1	25	1	null	null	null	A!03	42
Plant Shield Amulet (Worn)	<p>A plant shield amulet creates an energy field around you, resonating with magic frequencies that repel plants. You can move through undergrowth that acts as difficult terrain (such as bushes, fungal blooms, roots, and vines) at your normal speed and without taking damage from thorns or similar elements of the plant life. Plant creatures’ attacks and abilities, as well as spells and other magical effects such as the xenodruid’s grasping vines mystic connection power, affect you normally.</p>	Hybrid	1	300	null	null	null	null	DS05	43
Shotalashu Saddle	<p>This traditional saddle for shotalashu riders is adorned with small, colorful gems and engraved with intricate images of lashunta culture. More than a simple decoration, however, a shotalashu saddle amplifies and solidifies the lashunta’s telepathic bond with its mount through a series of telepathic relays that serve as conductors from the rider’s body to the shotalashu’s. While riding a shotalashu saddle, you gain a +5 bonus on Survival checks to ride the shotalashu. While austere, mass‑produced shotalashu saddles that provide the same benefit as handmade versions certainly exist, most lashuntas consider it disrespectful to their mount not to use a lovingly crafted artisanal saddle. Particularly beautiful saddles often serve as cherished heirlooms, passed down through generations, and it’s not uncommon for lashuntas to mark special milestones in their loved ones’ lives with the gift of a new shotalashu saddle. A functional shotalashu saddle costs 300 credits, though particularly elaborate or ancient specimens may be worth many times more.</p>	Hybrid	1	300		null	null	null	AA2	115
Software Imp, Tier 1	<p>Whether or not it has attained true consciousness, a software imp is a perverse and illegal AI obnoxious enough that the question is academic. Software imps come on memory sticks so they remain isolated from your own systems. A software imp has a tier, and it is ineffective on any computer of a higher tier than its own.<br/> You must have access to a computer to install a software imp on it, and you can do so as a full action. The imp renders its memory stick unusable on the way out, leaving no way to conclusively determine what was once stored there. Once installed, the software imp becomes an artificial personality on its host computer. If the computer already has an artificial personality, the imp finds and overwrites it if possible. Faced with an artificial personality to which it does not have access, the imp lies in wait until it gains access to that personality in order to replace it.<br/> Initially, the imp can access information and modules that were accessible to you when you installed the imp. It can gain further access if a user unwittingly uses more access while the imp is installed. The imp can also fool users into giving it more access by attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks with a bonus according to its tier.<br/> While acting as an artificial personality, the imp is as unhelpful as possible to anyone attempting to use the system. The software imp doesn’t ignore commands, but it interprets them in the worst way possible. It can misdirect, reveal unwanted information, obfuscate the truth, and otherwise aggravate and demoralize the user.<br/> Finding and removing a software imp requires a successful Computers check to hack the imp as if it were a computer of its tier. However, the imp copies and installs itself as redundantly as it can, based on its tier number, and it can revive itself so long as a single copy remains. A dismissal spell targeting a computer infested with software imps can remove the malicious AIs as if they were extraplanar creatures, each with a CR equal to its item level and a Will save bonus based on its tier.<br/> The tiers of software imps and the capabilities of each are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	1	400	null	null	null	null	ARM	124
Starstone Compass	<p>This small, clockwork navigational device hones in on mystical signals emitted by the Starstone resting at the heart of Absalom Station, calculating the compass’s precise distance from and direction relative to the enigmatic font. While you are in the Pact Worlds system, this device lets you automatically know which direction Absalom Station is in relation to your current location, and it grants you a +2 insight bonus to Piloting checks when astrogating throughout the Pact Worlds system.</p>	Hybrid	1	3	L	null	null	null	CRB	227
Thermal Regulator	<p>A thermal regulator unit works like a thermal regulator armor upgrade. However, the unit is a harness you wear with temperature regulating fluid and a belt-supported pump and power unit. The harness and belt unit can be worn under armor, but they have an independent power source. A thermal regulator unit can use any sort of battery, and the unit has a usage of 1 per hour or a fraction thereof.</p>	Hybrid	1	150	L	null	null	null	DF02	17
Empathic Depiction, Portrait	<p>Lashunta artists have techniques to collect emotions and memories associated with an individual and imprint them onto a representative piece of art lashuntas call an empathic depiction. To collect such memories, a telepathic artist interviews the subject along with those who know or have strong memories of the subject. This process takes at least a week. In the past, these objects were magical, and some still are, but most modern empathic depictions are hybrid items that use advanced holography to create realistic memorials. Creating such an empathic depiction is a crafting task that uses the Engineering skill (Starfinder Core Rulebook 235) or an appropriate artistic Profession skill in a similar way. (A wholly magical version uses Mysticism instead.)<br/> Creatures within range of an empathic depiction (based on its model) can feel the emotions and recall the memories placed within it. A creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC based on the model) to resist these experiences, which cause no damage or harmful effect. These hybrid items utilize magic and psychic energy, remaining active while an observer is in range. They can also be plugged into a power grid and operate continuously while such power flows.</p>	Hybrid	2	750	null	null	null	null	DF01	45

Metal Nitro, Silver	<p>Introduced into a vehicle’s engine through the vehicle’s control panel, metal nitro comes in magical capsules of soft metal. Unlike technological racing nitrous, which releases more oxygen into an engine’s system to help the fuel burn, metal nitro infuses the vehicle with a burst of magical power.<br/> As a move action, you can crush a capsule of metal nitro into a vehicle’s control panel, which increases the vehicle’s drive speed and full speed for a total of 10 rounds. If the pilot fails to take the race action within 1 round of activating the metal nitro or fails the Piloting check to race from a dead stop, the metal nitro forces the vehicle to move its full speed immediately in an uncontrolled manner. If the Pilot fails the check to race, or the nitro activates in an uncontrolled manner, the pilot and any passengers take bludgeoning damage according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> Metal nitro can be safely used only on a vehicle that has an equal or higher item level. If you use metal nitro of an item level higher than the target vehicle’s, the vehicle takes damage after the pilot races or the vehicle first moves because of the nitro. The amount of damage varies according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> The types of metal nitro and their speed increase, as well as potential passenger and vehicle damage, are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	2	175	null	null	null	null	ARM	123
Mindlink Circlet, Mk 1	<p>Although items with powers similar to those of the mindlink circlet have existed in the Pact Worlds for thousands of years, the technological components of the this useful item were an innovation that made its powers readily available.

Animistic Tools, Mk 1	<p>People often have superstitions regarding whether objects have a spirit or intelligence, and animistic tools were made with such beliefs in mind. Each of these tool kits has the power to communicate a user’s intentions to inanimate objects. When you use animistic tools with the appropriate skill and you fail a check, you can use the tool’s magic to reroll the check and take the higher result. In addition, as a move action, you can tap or bang a tool from the kit on a broken object, causing the object to ignore the penalties of being broken for a time. An item can benefit from animistic tools in this way only once per day, causing some engineers to joke that no one likes percussive maintenance.<br/> The model of the tools determines the number of rerolls per day and the time an item ignores the broken condition. Once you use a set of animistic tools, you can’t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	3	1350	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Book Of Predilections	<p>A Book of Predilections collects predilections from the Zamkan Commune into convenient volumes for contemplation. The price reflects these collections as digital files, downloadable to datapads or computers. Rare, hand-illuminated tomes, valued by collectors, can cost four times as much. The introspective nature of these thought puzzles helps the reader define their sense of self and personal desires. If you spend 30 minutes pondering the book after getting a full night’s rest, when you fail a Will saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, you can reroll the saving throw. Doing so takes no action, but you can do so only once after each qualifying reading. The benefit ends after 24 hours or when you get another full night’s rest.</p>	Hybrid	3	1500	null	null	null	null	A!04	52
Deoxy Pellet	<p>This fist-sized pellet was developed on the swampy world of Atachuuva as a dual-purpose safety measure. Methane vents and peat bogs are common amid the planet’s swamps, the risk of fire remains high, and the oversized insect life on the planet poses a threat to any settlement. A <em>deoxy pellet</em> offers some protection against these risks, and has gained some fame through the system due to a lighthearted marketing campaign based on the slogan, “Break in case of fire or giant bug!”<br/> You can crush a <em>deoxy pellet</em> as a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The magically enhanced chemical mixture within makes it so oxygen within a 30-foot radius of the point you break the pellet doesn’t easily diffuse to feed fire or flow into the spiracles of insects and other creatures that lack active breathing mechanisms. Natural fire goes out, and the burning condition deals half damage. In addition, vermin larger than Tiny are sickened while in the area (no saving throw). The change in oxygen persists for 5 rounds, but a light or moderate wind lowers the duration to 3 rounds, and a strong or stronger wind lowers the duration to 1 round.</p>	Hybrid	3	250	L	null	null	null	A!03	42
Hivejack, Mk 1	<p>During the combined efforts of the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds to repel attacks from the Swarm, an enterprising research team composed mostly of shirren and vesk mechanics developed the first hivejack to allow a user to “hack” into the hive mind of the Swarm in an effort to detect and manipulate the thoughts of individual Swarm components. A hivejack consists of a pair of small spherical applicators that are placed just above or below your visual sensors; it takes an uninterrupted 24 hours for the item to adjust to your mental patterns before you can use it. Each applicator is connected to a long, wispy tendril that lies flat upon your head or dangles from your face; this tendril taps into the Swarm’s hive mind through replicating specific pheromones, electrostatic fields, and psychic signals while, at the same time, blocking your own thoughts from the hive mind. Creatures with racial telepathy cannot use a hivejack. These items have not seen much use since the invasion, however, as prolonged use the technology leaves you vulnerable to being dominated by the Swarm hive mind. The effects of a hivejack depend on its model, as described below.</p>	Hybrid	3	1500	L	null	null	null	DF04	52
Mindshield Circlet, Basic	<p>When shirrens first arrived in the Chuuva system, they were still plagued by fears that despite the protection of Hylax, they might be forced back into the Swarm, losing all the individuality and freedom of choice they had come to embrace. Researchers explored ways to further insulate the empathic race from the Swarm’s psychic call, ranging from the ineffective to the distasteful to some outright unethical practices. The mindshield circlet is in the center of this gamut, although it has retained some utility beyond the potential it has to prevent Swarm manipulation.<br/> While wearing a mindshield circlet, you can’t use limited telepathy and telepathy, and those using such abilities can’t contact you. In addition, you can cast no spells and use no spell-like abilities that are mind-affecting. Furthermore, it is more difficult to affect you with such abilities, even beneficial ones. The mindshield circlet’s model determines a DC, providing protection against such effects. The creator of an effect must make a check, rolling 1d20 + caster level or CR against the DC to overcome your circlet’s protection and affect you normally.<br/> Even at the height of the shirrens’ collective fear of the Swarm, mindshield circlets were a poor solution, as most shirren found the loss of their telepathic abilities to be too isolating to bear for long. The items retain utility, especially by species that don’t rely on telepathy. Such species have copied the technology and make more use of these protective devices.</p>	Hybrid	3	1350	L	null	null	null	A!03	42
Motion-Detection Badge (Worn)	<p>This hexagon-shaped adornment can be activated or deactivated as a move action. A motiondetection badge has 4 charges, which refresh daily, and an hour of activation uses 1 charge. While active, as long as you haven’t moved for at least 1 round, the badge emits a quick flash of red light whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet, although creatures undetectable to normal vision (such as an invisible creature) don’t trigger the flash. This flash is sufficient to alert you, but doesn’t otherwise affect your vision or your actions. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door or substantial barrier (such as a wall at least 1 inch thick). You can attune the badge to a creature by touching it with the item, which takes a full action; you can attune the badge to up to 10 different creatures. When you are within 60 feet of one of these creatures, regardless of whether you have moved in the past round, the badge emits a yellow flash to let you know an ally is near. Attempting to attune an eleventh creature causes the badge to lose its attunement to the earliest attuned creature. Note that in certain environments, such as a crowded shopping center, the badge flashes so frequently as to be practically useless for detecting approaching threats.</p>	Hybrid	3	1350	L	null	null	null	AT01	10
Redundancy Belt (Worn)	<p>These devices were originally created by ilthisarian travelers early in their exploration of worlds beyond their native Arshalin. Most are wide mesh belts with entwined serpentine patterns, though redundancy belts made beyond Arshalin have a wider variety of appearances. After being worn for at least 24 hours, the belt creates duplicates of your existing vital organs that last as long as you wear the belt, magically and temporarily rearranging your internal anatomy to create space for them. You gain a +4 resistance bonus to Fortitude saving throws against poison, to withstand the harmful effects of thick and thin atmospheres, and to avoid choking when breathing in heavy smoke. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score, and you always take minimum damage from falls (as though rolling a 1 for each die of damage).</p>	Hybrid	3	1200	L	null	null	null	DS05	43

Ablative Insulation, Mk 1	<p>Civilization on Verces exists on the thin line between fiery heat and frozen desolation. Verthani’s unique perspective on the elements led them to develop temperature-sensitive compounds with remarkable properties. Ablative insulation comes in a single-use canister containing enchanted fullerene-based powder. In a process that takes 1 minute, you can spray the contents on a creature to thoroughly coat it with the powder (though it automatically avoids orifices and sensory organs such as the eyes, mouth, and nose). The creature coated gains energy resistance to all energy types (which doesn’t stack with any other source of energy resistance), and the ablative insulation wears away as it prevents damage. The coating lasts for 1 hour if not ablated away sooner. Multiple coatings don’t offer any additional benefit (ignore all but the highest-level coating). Each canister contains enough material to fully cover a single Medium or smaller creature, with any excess wasted. When applied to a Large creature, the insulation provides only half the energy resistance (rounded down) and total points of absorption unless a second canister is used. If applied to a Huge or larger creature, the insulation is wasted without effect.</p>	Hybrid	4	350	L	null	null	null	PWD	202

Creator Capsule, Mk 1	<p>Although it appears to be little more than an oblong case full of electronics, a creator capsule is a tiny 3D printer, with a programmable interface and a supply of UPBs stored in an extradimensional space. As a full action, you can connect the creator capsule wirelessly to your comm unit or computer, then command it to print one or more nonmagical personal or technological items. Printing an item requires you to have the plans on the connected device or an infosphere connection through which you can download the blueprints.<br/> A creator capsule takes 1 round to create an item, plus 1 round per bulk of the item above light. No individual printed item can have a bulk greater than 3. The creator capsule consumes itself during the printing process. Although the printer can be stopped as a move action, doing so renders the capsule useless for further printing. An item printed by the creator capsule is of average quality, and it has the statistics of an ordinary item of its type.<br/> Based on its type, a creator capsule has the following cost and level limits on items it creates.</p>	Hybrid	4	2000	L	null	null	null	ARM	120

Gravitic Modulator (Worn)	<p>Gravitic-modulator technology was developed on Silselrik, derived from the selamids’ innate ability to withstand the stresses of changing gravity. Originally designed by the selamids for their own use when venturing away from the safety of their megadoplexes, these devices see common use among offworlders visiting Silselrik for commerce, research, or work in the diamond mines. While a selamid simply absorbs the device into its protoplasm, most humanoids wear the gravitic modulator as a backpack due to its size and weight.<br/> While wearing a gravitic modulator, you are shielded from some of the effects of rapidly changing gravity.

Deploying or recovering the canister is a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity. While deployed, creatures within 20 feet of the gatherer have cover against ranged attacks and area effects that deal only electricity damage, such as arcing surge or an attack from an arc pistol. Such effects bend toward the lightning gatherer.

Psychic Booster	<p>This circlet, originally designed by lashuntas, fits over the wearer’s brow and wraps around the wearer’s antennae (if any). A psychic booster augments the power of your inherent psychic abilities. If you have telepathy, the range of your telepathy doubles.

Static Glider	<p>The static charge prevalent throughout Tarchuuva’s upper atmosphere has given rise to a recreational activity called static gliding. This leisure activity is restrictive due to the costs of the equipment and travel to Tarchuuva, but competitive static gliding was one of the most widely viewed sporting activities on Ilemchuuva.<br/> A static glider is a thin metallic sheet incorporated onto a minimal nanocarbon frame roughly 10 feet across. You can strap into a harness on the glider’s underside, taking a full action. The glider’s surface is designed with a microtexture that allows it to build up an electromagnetic charge and use that energy to produce lift. A glider requires no power source on Tarchuuva or during electromagnetic storms, but otherwise, the device requires a battery and consumes 1 charge per minute. While using a static glider, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability. You are flat-footed while using the glider to fly unless you dedicate two hands to steering it.</p>	Hybrid	4	1800	1	null	null	null	A!03	44

Digital Harrow Deck	<p>A digital harrow deck is a modernization of an archaic means of fortune-telling whose roots trace back to vanished Golarion. Once per day, you can activate the deck as a full action. It projects holograms of 54 cards, which buzz around you. To begin the reading, you ask a question aloud to the harrow deck, causing all of the cards to come together as a deck; then, the deck uses hundreds of advanced pseudomystical calculations to deal a three-by-three array of cards for you, which it then uses to vocally interpret the circumstances surrounding your question. This works as the augury spell, with a spell level equal to the deck’s item level.<br/> Additionally, a mystic who has a digital harrow deck and who also knows augury can ignore the spell’s requirement that a Resolve Point be spent to cast it. A mystic can do this a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus.<br/> A technomancer can designate a digital harrow deck as her spell cache.

Mnemonic Editor, Mk 1	<p>A mnemonic editor consists of a complex series of brain implant injectors, digital harrow deck autoreaders, illusion runes, and virtual-reality programs, all controlled by an enchanted analysis computer and attached to a mobile surgical bed. The network of magic and technology is capable of removing experiences from a patient strapped to the bed over the course of a single 24-hour session. Skills and knowledge can be excised, lessons unlearned and muscle memory altered. Memories are not lost entirely; the patient still recalls what it did during its life, whom it met, and how it felt about the moments it experienced, but the impact of those experiences is subtly altered. The device then creates a new set of experiences—clearly artificial but no less effective—by leaving impressions and implanting new knacks, muscle memory, reflexes, and skills.<br/> If you use a mnemonic editor, you can undo 2 character levels’ worth of decisions about which class levels you took, which feats you selected, how you applied any level-based increases to ability scores, how you assigned new skill ranks, and so on. All decisions you made as a result of advancing over the previous 2 character levels you gained are undone. You then make new selections, including new class levels, feats, skills, and the like, as if you had regained the 2 missing character levels. Go through the normal process of advancing your character through each of these 2 levels.<br/> Each mnemonic editor works only once—the strain on its technology and the consequences of rewriting your past to even this small degree cause it to break down into valueless junk after a single session. Additionally, the alterations made to you render it more difficult for such extraordinary procedures to be effective in the future. A mk 1 mnemonic editor cannot be used on you if you have already benefited from one in the past. However, it is possible to use a more advanced mk 2 model that functions in the same manner, even if you have already used a mk 1 mnemonic editor. Of course, you can only benefit from a mk 2 mnemonic editor once. There exist even more advanced mk 3 and mk 4 models, and each can be used on you once even after you have used a lower-level mnemonic editor, but they are so expensive that they are usually produced only upon request.</p>	Hybrid	5	500	10	null	null	null	CRB	226
Null-Space Chamber, Mk 1	<p>A null-space chamber is a circular device often designed to be strapped to an arm or backpack. When you press a button on the side, the device creates a circular extradimensional rift to a pocket space, the size of which is determined by the null-space chamber’s model. You can close it by pressing the button again, causing the entrance to the space to disappear. Anything stored within the space remains, however, traveling with the item. The null-space chamber can be opened and closed only from the outside.<br/> The only air within the pocket space is that which enters when you open the entrance. The device does not accumulate bulk even as its pocket space is filled. Each null-space chamber is associated with its own particular extradimensional space. Each null-space chamber can carry a set amount of bulk, after which it can no longer be closed (even if it has room left for more material). Spells and items that contain or create extradimensional spaces, such as other null-space chambers, do not function within a null-space chamber’s pocket dimension.<br/> A readout on a null-space chamber automatically catalogs all items within it, and if the chamber is open, you can call up any such item and have it placed in your hand as a full action.</p>	Hybrid	5	3050	L	null	null	null	CRB	227
Null-Space Tumor	<p>While it is rare, some adventurers claim that exposing a nullspace chamber to powerful teleportation magic (such as plane shift) can result in an unusual metallic growth appearing within the chamber. Scholars have yet to determine the true nature of these anomalies, which they call null-space tumors. A null-space tumor seems to have no obvious use or purpose, and merchants might sell you a null-space chamber with one inside without realizing it. The listed price and level is for a mk 1 null-space chamber with a null-space tumor inside; rumors persist that larger and more disruptive null-space tumors exist. A null-space tumor has 1 bulk and can’t be permanently removed from its associated chamber. You can’t purposefully call up a null-space tumor from its chamber, but each time you call up another item from the chamber, there is a 20% chance that the null-space tumor appears instead. When that happens, the tumor’s unusual properties randomly cause one of the following effects (roll 1d8 to determine the effect), after which the null-space tumor immediately teleports itself back into the chamber. The only way to destroy a null-space tumor is to destroy the null-space chamber it’s attached to. <table> <tr><th>D8</th><th>Effect</th></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>You and all your gear become invisible for 1d4+1 rounds, but you move as if through a thick soup; your speed is reduced to 10 feet during this time.</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>Duplicates appear around you, as if you were affected by the spell mirror image for 1d4 minutes. However, you see doubles of every creature and object, meaning you have a 50% miss chance to attack a creature and a 50% chance to waste your action when you try to pick up or manipulate an object.</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>You gain the benefits of comprehend languages for 1 hour, but anything you write down or type on a computer during this time instantly vanishes as per erase.</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>You gain the benefits of keen senses for 10 minutes, but you take a –2 penalty to saving throws against sensedependent effects during this time.</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>The tumor produces a wisp ally (as per the spell of the same name) that lasts for 1d4+1 rounds, but you don’t control it.

Software Imp, Tier 3	<p>Whether or not it has attained true consciousness, a software imp is a perverse and illegal AI obnoxious enough that the question is academic. Software imps come on memory sticks so they remain isolated from your own systems. A software imp has a tier, and it is ineffective on any computer of a higher tier than its own.<br/> You must have access to a computer to install a software imp on it, and you can do so as a full action. The imp renders its memory stick unusable on the way out, leaving no way to conclusively determine what was once stored there. Once installed, the software imp becomes an artificial personality on its host computer. If the computer already has an artificial personality, the imp finds and overwrites it if possible. Faced with an artificial personality to which it does not have access, the imp lies in wait until it gains access to that personality in order to replace it.<br/> Initially, the imp can access information and modules that were accessible to you when you installed the imp. It can gain further access if a user unwittingly uses more access while the imp is installed. The imp can also fool users into giving it more access by attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks with a bonus according to its tier.<br/> While acting as an artificial personality, the imp is as unhelpful as possible to anyone attempting to use the system. The software imp doesn’t ignore commands, but it interprets them in the worst way possible. It can misdirect, reveal unwanted information, obfuscate the truth, and otherwise aggravate and demoralize the user.<br/> Finding and removing a software imp requires a successful Computers check to hack the imp as if it were a computer of its tier. However, the imp copies and installs itself as redundantly as it can, based on its tier number, and it can revive itself so long as a single copy remains. A dismissal spell targeting a computer infested with software imps can remove the malicious AIs as if they were extraplanar creatures, each with a CR equal to its item level and a Will save bonus based on its tier.<br/> The tiers of software imps and the capabilities of each are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	5	2800	null	null	null	null	ARM	124
Swarm Battery	<p>When weapon designers couldn’t achieve an acceptable power output with their Swarm-based armaments, they created the Swarm battery, a new type of living power cell. Similar to the insulated gland of a generator drone, a Swarm battery consists of still-living tissue that reflexively adapts to power any item, including non-Swarm varieties, functioning as a high-capacity battery with 40 charges. A Swarm battery can adapt to be recharged at any charging station. It also recharges on its own at the rate of 1 charge per hour, provided it remains within 60 feet of ambient nearby electricity, such as power conduits in a city, a starship’s power core, consistent static electricity, or even the small amount of electricity running through a living body.</p>	Hybrid	5	550	L	null	null	null	A!01	52
Universal Solvent, Basic	<p>Sold in enchanted vials that hold one application each, universal solvent is a magical chemical mixture that can dissolve almost every known substance in the galaxy. (Universal solvent can’t damage creatures.) As a standard action, you can splash universal solvent on an object. If a creature holds or wears the item, you must hit with a melee attack against that creature’s EAC. One application of solvent can cover five objects of light bulk, one object of 1 bulk, or a 5-foot area of a surface. When the solvent’s vial is emptied, it leaves a clean, empty vial with no residue.<br/> Universal solvent dissolves adhesives instantaneously, including the strands released by stickybomb grenades, provided the adhesive is of an item level equal to or lower than the solvent. The solvent also softens objects it coats, suppressing hardness according to the solvent’s type. As a full action, a creature can wipe off an application of universal solvent, ending the solvent’s effect on the cleaned object (but not the object used to clean it).<br/> If an object is exposed to universal solvent for 1 minute, the object takes an amount of damage equal to twice the amount by which the solvent’s hardness suppression exceeded the object’s actual hardness. The solvent then becomes inert and turns to dust, and the object returns to its normal hardness.<br/> Universal solvent comes in the following types.</p>	Hybrid	5	500	null	null	null	null	ARM	125
Empathic Depiction, Statue	<p>Lashunta artists have techniques to collect emotions and memories associated with an individual and imprint them onto a representative piece of art lashuntas call an empathic depiction. To collect such memories, a telepathic artist interviews the subject along with those who know or have strong memories of the subject. This process takes at least a week. In the past, these objects were magical, and some still are, but most modern empathic depictions are hybrid items that use advanced holography to create realistic memorials. Creating such an empathic depiction is a crafting task that uses the Engineering skill (Starfinder Core Rulebook 235) or an appropriate artistic Profession skill in a similar way. (A wholly magical version uses Mysticism instead.)<br/> Creatures within range of an empathic depiction (based on its model) can feel the emotions and recall the memories placed within it. A creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC based on the model) to resist these experiences, which cause no damage or harmful effect. These hybrid items utilize magic and psychic energy, remaining active while an observer is in range. They can also be plugged into a power grid and operate continuously while such power flows.</p>	Hybrid	6	4500	2	null	null	null	DF01	45
Holding Gloves, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>Holding gloves have copper mesh on the fingertips and forming a concavity on the palm. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> Once per day as a standard action while wearing the gloves, you can use their embedded spell as a spell-like ability. If you hit with a melee attack (including an unarmed strike), you can use the spell from the gloves as a reaction, targeting the same creature the attack hit, without provoking an attack of opportunity. After the first time you cast the spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it again, up to two more times on a given day. Once you use a given pair of holding gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.<br/> The spell imbued in holding gloves depends on their model, as follows.</p>	Hybrid	6	4250	L	null	null	null	ARM	122
Metal Nitro, Gold	<p>Introduced into a vehicle’s engine through the vehicle’s control panel, metal nitro comes in magical capsules of soft metal. Unlike technological racing nitrous, which releases more oxygen into an engine’s system to help the fuel burn, metal nitro infuses the vehicle with a burst of magical power.<br/> As a move action, you can crush a capsule of metal nitro into a vehicle’s control panel, which increases the vehicle’s drive speed and full speed for a total of 10 rounds. If the pilot fails to take the race action within 1 round of activating the metal nitro or fails the Piloting check to race from a dead stop, the metal nitro forces the vehicle to move its full speed immediately in an uncontrolled manner. If the Pilot fails the check to race, or the nitro activates in an uncontrolled manner, the pilot and any passengers take bludgeoning damage according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> Metal nitro can be safely used only on a vehicle that has an equal or higher item level. If you use metal nitro of an item level higher than the target vehicle’s, the vehicle takes damage after the pilot races or the vehicle first moves because of the nitro. The amount of damage varies according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> The types of metal nitro and their speed increase, as well as potential passenger and vehicle damage, are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	6	675	null	null	null	null	ARM	123
Phase Detector	<p>A small circular device that usually resembles a pocket watch, a phase detector can also be a module attached to a personal comm unit. If a creature or object teleports or changes planes, such as by being summoned, within 120 feet of you, the phase detector alerts you to the event and informs you of its distance and direction relative to you. A phase detector doesn’t specify the type of event it detected, and it doesn’t pinpoint the event’s location.</p>	Hybrid	6	4000	L	null	null	null	ARM	124
Scrambler Gloves, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>Runes and twisting lines crisscross the shimmering surface of scrambler gloves. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> You can touch a creature with these gloves by attempting a melee attack against your target’s EAC. If you hit, the scrambler gloves disrupt the target’s mental faculties, rendering the victim confused and shaken for 1 round if it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the item level + your key ability score modifier), or for 1d3+1 rounds on a failed save. However, when the creature rolls on the confusion table, a result of 51–75 causes the creature to instead be staggered, and on a result of 76–100, the creature is instead staggered and can’t cast spells or activate supernatural abilities. This is a mind-affecting effect.<br/> After you use the gloves, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use them again. The gloves’ type determines how many times they can be used per day and how many Resolve Points you can spend for additional activations per day. Once you use a given pair of scrambler gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	6	4500	L	null	null	null	ARM	124
Tactokinesis Gloves (Worn)	<p>Tactokinesis gloves use an array of magical and magnetic sensors to extend and amplify the wearer’s sense of touch. They were first developed in the Diaspora to allow miners to locate veins of metal by touch through the material of their space suits. It soon found applications for thieves and explorers alike. Using the gloves, you can perceive and manipulate objects close at hand without actually touching them, and you can even sense details hidden just below the surface.<br/> While wearing a pair of tactokinesis gloves, you can use the Perception and Physical Science skills to examine a metal or technological construct or object within your reach, whether or not you can perceive the object with other senses. In addition, the gloves provide a +2 circumstance bonus to Engineering checks to assess stability or disable a device, and they count as necessary tools for such purposes. You can attempt such checks without directly touching the target, as well as use similar abilities that manipulate technology by touch, such as the overload mechanic class feature. In a zero-gravity environment, you can use the limited telekinesis provided by the gloves to pick up and move objects of up to 1 bulk without actually touching them. As a standard action, you can use the gloves to deliver a disruptive pulse to an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype. If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 13 + your Dexterity modifier), it is dazed for 1 round. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this ability (regardless of the result), it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.<br/> The range of this telekinesis is limited to your reach, as you must be almost touching the target to manipulate it. Tactokinesis gloves do not function through a force field.</p>	Hybrid	6	4450	L	null	null	null	PWD	203
Animistic Tools, Mk 2	<p>People often have superstitions regarding whether objects have a spirit or intelligence, and animistic tools were made with such beliefs in mind. Each of these tool kits has the power to communicate a user’s intentions to inanimate objects. When you use animistic tools with the appropriate skill and you fail a check, you can use the tool’s magic to reroll the check and take the higher result. In addition, as a move action, you can tap or bang a tool from the kit on a broken object, causing the object to ignore the penalties of being broken for a time. An item can benefit from animistic tools in this way only once per day, causing some engineers to joke that no one likes percussive maintenance.<br/> The model of the tools determines the number of rerolls per day and the time an item ignores the broken condition. Once you use a set of animistic tools, you can’t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	7	5500	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Breath-Stealer Mask	<p>This mask of dark stone is just large enough to fit over the nose and mouth of a human, although it has a hole about an inch across in the center. A ring of brassy metal, an alloy of djezet and mithral, surrounds this hole on the mask’s outside. The mask counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. As a standard action while wearing the mask, you can forcefully inhale. If you do so, creatures that need to breathe within a 30-foot-radius spread of you must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or become short of breath, rendering them fatigued for 1 minute. You can exclude any number of creatures from this effect. Environmental protections offer no benefit against this effect. A target exhausted by the mask can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending that condition on itself if successful. A target that succeeds at such a save still remains fatigued for the full duration. Once you use this item, you can’t do so again until you take a 10-minute rest during which you could regain Stamina Points. If you use any breath-stealer mask, you can’t use another for the same period. If you try to use any breath-stealer mask more than three times per day, the mask targets you and every breathing creature it can within range of its power. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate the mask without being subjected to these limitations, but you can spend no more than 2 Resolve Points per day to activate any breath-stealer mask.</p>	Hybrid	7	6800	L	null	null	null	DF04	33
Mi-Go Hollowskin	<p>Mi-go use the body parts of humanoid creatures— predominantly the hollowed head, severed hands, and parts of the neural and circulatory tissue—to create mi-go hollowskins. Fungal mycelia connect and strengthen the other portions. Mi-go wear these macabre devices to appear to be the individual from which the humanoid tissue comes. You can wear a mi-go hollowskin only if you are Medium or Small. While wearing the skin, you can activate it as a standard action to appear to be the specific person the device was made from, using Mysticism as if it were Disguise for your check. The DC of this check doesn’t increase for changes in features, size, race, or creature type except against Perception checks that involve physical examination of body parts other than the hands and head. This altered appearance lasts for 1 hour, after which the hollowskin can be activated again.</p>	Hybrid	7	5500	L	null	null	null	AA2	83
Mindshield Circlet, Mk 1	<p>When shirrens first arrived in the Chuuva system, they were still plagued by fears that despite the protection of Hylax, they might be forced back into the Swarm, losing all the individuality and freedom of choice they had come to embrace. Researchers explored ways to further insulate the empathic race from the Swarm’s psychic call, ranging from the ineffective to the distasteful to some outright unethical practices. The mindshield circlet is in the center of this gamut, although it has retained some utility beyond the potential it has to prevent Swarm manipulation.<br/> While wearing a mindshield circlet, you can’t use limited telepathy and telepathy, and those using such abilities can’t contact you. In addition, you can cast no spells and use no spell-like abilities that are mind-affecting. Furthermore, it is more difficult to affect you with such abilities, even beneficial ones. The mindshield circlet’s model determines a DC, providing protection against such effects. The creator of an effect must make a check, rolling 1d20 + caster level or CR against the DC to overcome your circlet’s protection and affect you normally.<br/> Even at the height of the shirrens’ collective fear of the Swarm, mindshield circlets were a poor solution, as most shirren found the loss of their telepathic abilities to be too isolating to bear for long. The items retain utility, especially by species that don’t rely on telepathy. Such species have copied the technology and make more use of these protective devices.</p>	Hybrid	7	6250	L	null	null	null	A!03	42
Motospheres (Pack Of 4)	<p>Sold in blister packs of four (the price and bulk listed in Table 4–14 are for a set of four), motospheres are metal orbs that are each the size of a grenade and traced with glyphs. As a standard action, you can deploy one to four motospheres from the same set; each rolls into its own square within 15 feet of you and instantly transforms into a vehicle similar to a basic enercycle (Starfinder Core Rulebook 228) with the changes noted below. If a creature or object occupies a square a vehicle formed from a motosphere would occupy, the motosphere doesn’t transform. You choose each vehicle’s initial heading as it transforms. After being deployed, a vehicle turns back into a motosphere after 1 hour, or as a move action you can turn it back into a motosphere by entering a series of commands on the vehicle’s controls. A single motosphere takes 24 hours to recharge before it can be used again.<br/> A vehicle formed out of a motosphere has a hardness of 7, and its hover jets allow it travel over both land and water (though not underwater). The vehicle has 14 Hit Points and becomes broken when it is reduced to 7 Hit Points or fewer. A vehicle that is reduced to 0 Hit Points turns back into a motosphere and can’t be used until it is repaired (treat it as if it were broken). Motospheres can be sold back only in their original pack of four for the normal 10% of the set’s purchase price; a set that is missing even one motosphere (or containing one that is broken) can be sold back for 2% of the set’s purchase price.</p>	Hybrid	7	5600	L	null	null	null	PWD	202
Retrieval Charms, Mk 1	<p>Most retrieval charms are bejeweled decorations, although some are knickknacks that depict popular idols or fictional characters. These items come in a pair, each charm attuned to the other with magically enhanced quantum entanglement. It takes 1 minute to attach a charm to an object, and this object can have no more than 3 bulk. As a move action, you can activate the second charm while holding it, teleporting the first charm and its attached object to you. If you do so, the object instantly appears in hand if you have enough hands free to grasp it. Otherwise, it appears in your space. The attached object teleports to you even if it is worn or carried by another creature. Each set of retrieval charms can be used one time per day.<br/> The charms’ type limits the scale of the teleportation, as follows.</p>	Hybrid	7	6500	L	null	null	null	ARM	124

Ablative Insulation, Mk 2	<p>Civilization on Verces exists on the thin line between fiery heat and frozen desolation. Verthani’s unique perspective on the elements led them to develop temperature-sensitive compounds with remarkable properties. Ablative insulation comes in a single-use canister containing enchanted fullerene-based powder. In a process that takes 1 minute, you can spray the contents on a creature to thoroughly coat it with the powder (though it automatically avoids orifices and sensory organs such as the eyes, mouth, and nose). The creature coated gains energy resistance to all energy types (which doesn’t stack with any other source of energy resistance), and the ablative insulation wears away as it prevents damage. The coating lasts for 1 hour if not ablated away sooner. Multiple coatings don’t offer any additional benefit (ignore all but the highest-level coating). Each canister contains enough material to fully cover a single Medium or smaller creature, with any excess wasted. When applied to a Large creature, the insulation provides only half the energy resistance (rounded down) and total points of absorption unless a second canister is used. If applied to a Huge or larger creature, the insulation is wasted without effect.</p>	Hybrid	8	1500	L	null	null	null	PWD	202
Allegiance Collar (Worn)	<p>A black iron choker, an allegiance collar contains technomagical circuitry that adapts to someone who willingly wears it for 24 hours. It grants such a wearer the benefits and weaknesses of the fire subtype and the solar adaptation universal creature rule. The collar can be removed only with a special key or a successful DC 32 Engineering check.<br/> In addition, this collar contains a self-destruct feature that can be triggered in several ways: via a specific encrypted hybrid electronic signal, if the collar doesn’t receive a similar sort of signal (usually with paired encryption) in a specified amount of time, upon certain individuals uttering a command word, or if the wearer simply wills it. The collar also activates if a creature fails the Engineering check to remove it.<br/> Upon activation, the collar illuminates with red light and the device injects the wearer with nanites adapted to the wearer’s genetic code. These nanites destroy a wearer’s brain in seconds (death is instantaneous), obliterate the head in 1 round, and then disassemble the rest of the body in a number of rounds equal to 1 + the number of steps by which the creature’s size category exceeds Small. Once the process is over, the nanites decompose, and all that remains of them and their victim is molecular dust. The nanites are harmless to organisms they aren’t adapted to disassemble, and they decompose seconds after being removed from the collar.<br/> After the collar activates, its magic fades, becoming just an ornate piece of iron jewelry worth about 20 credits.</p>	Hybrid	8	10000	L	null	null	null	DF01	16

Creator Capsule, Mk 2	<p>Although it appears to be little more than an oblong case full of electronics, a creator capsule is a tiny 3D printer, with a programmable interface and a supply of UPBs stored in an extradimensional space. As a full action, you can connect the creator capsule wirelessly to your comm unit or computer, then command it to print one or more nonmagical personal or technological items. Printing an item requires you to have the plans on the connected device or an infosphere connection through which you can download the blueprints.<br/> A creator capsule takes 1 round to create an item, plus 1 round per bulk of the item above light. No individual printed item can have a bulk greater than 3. The creator capsule consumes itself during the printing process. Although the printer can be stopped as a move action, doing so renders the capsule useless for further printing.

In addition, hybrid and magic items within a sealed dromada clutch cannot be detected by divination effects, such as detect magic and arcane sight. A sealed dromada clutch acts as a container with a permanent security seal spell and a good lock.</p>	Hybrid	8	9200	1	null	null	null	AA3	29
Kinetic Converter, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>A kinetic converter, also called a rebound generator or bouncy ball, is a 4-inch spherical generator that can capture incoming energy and magically redirect it. You wear the converter on your body. The converter counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in your armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to its mark number.<br/> If you are the target of an attack, spell, or similar effect that deals you damage while you wear the kinetic converter, you can activate the device as a reaction, provided the effect wasn’t a critical hit. Once activated, the converter disperses the kinetic energy of the attack. Instead of taking damage, you are knocked away from the source of the damage a distance based on the convertor’s type, rounding the damage up to the nearest 5. You can fall prone during this movement to halve the distance you move. If you hit an obstacle before moving the distance the converter threw you, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 foot increment you would have traveled, rounded up to the nearest 10 feet.<br/> This damage conversion protects you against additional effects if those effects relied on the damage you negated. For example, a creature’s poisonous bite can’t poison you without dealing you damage. A kinetic converter protects you only from attacks and similar effects, not from hazards such as lava or extreme gravity. The device works against falling damage, but the conversion hurls you back into the air.<br/> The damage-to-distance conversion rate and daily uses of a kinetic converter are based on its model. Once you benefit from a given kinetic converter, using a different one before 24 hours have passed throws off your sense of balance and you become sickened until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.</p>	Hybrid	8	10500	L	null	null	null	ARM	123
Memory Crypt (Worn)	<p>An accessory of bone-like plastic worn on the body near the brain, a memory crypt uses magical microcircuitry to keep an ongoing record of your experiences and monitor your vital signs. A memory crypt must be worn for 24 hours to adapt to your neurophysiology. During this time, it records nothing, but thereafter, it records your memories and experiences. After the item adapts to you, you can set a passcode to prevent those who don’t know the word or phrase you set from activating the device. A hacker can bypass the password with a successful DC 30 Computers check.<br/> If you remove the memory crypt or die, the item stops recording, though it preserves the record of your personality and vitals up to that point. Someone who has the memory crypt can activate it as a standard action. Doing so displays a hologram of you in a form called a memory ghost. This “ghost” can answer up to six questions. Its knowledge is limited to what you knew up to the point the record in the memory crypt ends, including the languages you spoke.<br/> Your ghost answers and converses with creatures as you would, with the attitudes you hold. If you trust the creature asking questions, the memory ghost answers truthfully and helpfully. Otherwise, the ghost can refuse to answer questions or attempt to deceive the questioner using your Bluff skill. A creature can attempt a Computers check to hack the memory crypt to erase it or force your memory ghost to answer questions truthfully. The DC to erase the memory crypt is 20 + your Bluff bonus or your level or CR, whichever is higher. The DC to force your memory ghost to answer is 5 higher. If a memory crypt is erased before being used to question the memory ghost it contains, it can be reused. Additionally, a memory crypt that contains an intact memory ghost can be used as the representation required for casting raise dead or the monument required for reincarnate. If used in this way to successfully cast either spell, the memory crypt is consumed.<br/> Once a memory crypt is activated, the memory ghost remains for 10 minutes or until it answers six questions. Magic powers the circuitry to replicate brain patterns. These patterns are disrupted if another power source is patched into the item in an attempt to prolong the memory ghost. When the duration ends, the memory crypt can be activated to project the memory ghost’s image, but the memory ghost is gone and can no longer interact, answer questions, or serve as the focus for raise dead or restoration. A memory crypt in this state can’t be reused.</p>	Hybrid	8	9500	null	null	null	null	ARM	123
Mi-Go Brain Cylinder	<p>The mi-go brain cylinder is part of the most infamous mi-go surgical procedure, in which a creature’s brain is extracted and made an organic memory bank. The biotech cylinder suspends an extracted brain in a matrix of biotechnological and magical slime that sustains the tissue and suppresses any mental powers the brain has. Inside the cylinder, a brain can survive indefinitely, locked away in its own thoughts. Attachments can allow the brain to see, hear, and speak; migo often attach such gear to access the brain’s information.<br/> Once a mi-go brain cylinder has a speech attachment, it can converse. It has all its skills and memories, but nothing about the cylinder compels the brain to answer questions or to do so truthfully. Most enslaved brains have been conditioned via pain and isolation to be compliant to questioning, but those within newly created cylinders might need coaxing to cooperate. A brain is susceptible to any spell or power it was susceptible to before it became disembodied. Some mi-go have powers that allow them to encourage or force a brain’s compliance or to telepathically probe a brain for desired data.</p>	Hybrid	8	10000	1	null	null	null	AA2	83
Mindlink Circlet, Mk 2	<p>Although items with powers similar to those of the mindlink circlet have existed in the Pact Worlds for thousands of years, the technological components of the this useful item were an innovation that made its powers readily available.

Vampiric Charger	<p>Carved to resemble a grotesque, bestial head, a vampiric charger has a wide maw with a pair of sharpened fangs serving as prongs. The charger converts life force into magical power and then into electricity.<br/> As a move action, you can insert a battery into the vampiric charger, and as another move action, you can stab the charger's fangs into a helpless or willing creature. Your target loses 1d4+1 Hit Points, which can’t be negated or mitigated in any way without causing the charger to fail. Every round thereafter, the creature takes 1 Constitution damage, and the battery attached to the charger regains 10 charges (up to its maximum). Once attached to a creature, the vampiric charger continues to inflict Constitution damage until it is removed or the creature dies, even if the battery is fully charged. A creature can remove the charger as a move action.<br/> Each time a battery is recharged in this way, it has a 20% chance to become corrupted. If the creature the charger is attached to dies while a battery is charging, that battery immediately becomes corrupted. Only a vampiric charger can recharge such a corrupted battery.</p>	Hybrid	8	10000	L	null	null	null	ARM	125
Adjudicator's Eye	<p>A few years ago, a Qabarat-based news agency broadcast an investigative report about a small planet in the Vast called Aurok 6, which featured a near-utopian civilization on its surface but a complicated infrastructure of prisons below. According to the report, Aurok 6’s aboveground nations enjoy peace and quiet due to the contributions of a planetary law enforcement agency with international jurisdiction, known only as the Adjudicators, who wield psychic technology and governmental authority to act as judge, jury, and executioners when pursuing criminals. Since the broadcast, several weapons manufacturers have secretly visited the planet, and now examples of experimental “judgment tech” weapons accessories can be found on various dark infospheres throughout the Pact Worlds. The most notable of these is a scope, known as an adjudicator’s eye, that can supposedly determine the guilt or innocence of a target. An adjudicator’s eye functions as a combined laser scope and nightvision scope (Starfinder Armory 61), but it also contains mnemonopathic sensors capable of scanning a target’s memories for recollections of a specified crime or attempted crime. Once per day, in a process that takes 1 minute, you can program the scope’s sensors with a single yes-or-no question testing responsibility for a particular crime, such as “Did the target attempt to blow up my starship?” or “Did the target plant the explosive device in the Eoxian embassy?” Three times per day, you can activate an adjudicator’s eye attached to a weapon as a move action. For the next 10 minutes, when aiming or looking through the scope, the sensors automatically scan targets to reveal their perception of guilt or innocence in regards to that question. Each target must succeed at a DC 18 Will saving throw or the adjudicator’s eye searches their memories for information about the specified question. These memories indicate only whether or not the target remembers themself as being innocent or guilty of the crime in question, and they do not necessarily reflect the truth (as in the case of someone who has been affected by modify memory). The scope places a “guilty” indicator over any target that recalls participating in the specified crime, and an “innocent” indicator over any target that has no memory of the crime or who succeeded at the Will save. Deactivating an adjudicator’s eye is a move action. The adjudicator’s eye imposes a –2 penalty on attack rolls made with the weapon it is attached to against any unscanned target or any target the scope has deemed innocent.</p>	Hybrid	9	12500	L	null	null	null	DF04	51
Captive-Star Amulet, Red Dwarf (Worn)	<p>The pendant of a captive-star amulet is a miniature containment field that holds magical energy compressed to resemble a tiny star. While you wear the amulet, if a spell includes you as a target, the necklace allows you to use the counter option of dispel magic against that spell as a reaction. You must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + half the amulet’s item level + your key ability score modifier). A captive-star amulet works once per day, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate it a second time during that same day. Once you use a given captive-star amulet, you can’t use a different one for 24 hours.<br/> Captive star amulets come in three types with varying functions.</p>	Hybrid	9	14500	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Entropy Gloves (Worn)	<p>These dark gloves have silver claws and a clear hemisphere embedded on the back of the hand that contains a writhing ball of negative energy. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> Once per day as a standard action while wearing the gloves, you can use entropic grasp as a spell-like ability (save DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier; caster level 9th). If you hit with a melee attack (including an unarmed strike), you can use the spell from the gloves as a reaction, targeting the same creature the attack hit, without provoking an attack of opportunity. After the first time you cast the spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it again, up to two more times on a given day. Once you use a given pair of entropy gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	9	13000	L	null	null	null	ARM	122
Hivejack, Mk 2	<p>During the combined efforts of the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds to repel attacks from the Swarm, an enterprising research team composed mostly of shirren and vesk mechanics developed the first hivejack to allow a user to “hack” into the hive mind of the Swarm in an effort to detect and manipulate the thoughts of individual Swarm components. A hivejack consists of a pair of small spherical applicators that are placed just above or below your visual sensors; it takes an uninterrupted 24 hours for the item to adjust to your mental patterns before you can use it. Each applicator is connected to a long, wispy tendril that lies flat upon your head or dangles from your face; this tendril taps into the Swarm’s hive mind through replicating specific pheromones, electrostatic fields, and psychic signals while, at the same time, blocking your own thoughts from the hive mind. Creatures with racial telepathy cannot use a hivejack. These items have not seen much use since the invasion, however, as prolonged use the technology leaves you vulnerable to being dominated by the Swarm hive mind. The effects of a hivejack depend on its model, as described below.</p>	Hybrid	9	13750	L	null	null	null	DF04	52
Null-Space Chamber, Mk 2	<p>A null-space chamber is a circular device often designed to be strapped to an arm or backpack. When you press a button on the side, the device creates a circular extradimensional rift to a pocket space, the size of which is determined by the null-space chamber’s model. You can close it by pressing the button again, causing the entrance to the space to disappear. Anything stored within the space remains, however, traveling with the item. The null-space chamber can be opened and closed only from the outside.<br/> The only air within the pocket space is that which enters when you open the entrance. The device does not accumulate bulk even as its pocket space is filled. Each null-space chamber is associated with its own particular extradimensional space. Each null-space chamber can carry a set amount of bulk, after which it can no longer be closed (even if it has room left for more material). Spells and items that contain or create extradimensional spaces, such as other null-space chambers, do not function within a null-space chamber’s pocket dimension.<br/> A readout on a null-space chamber automatically catalogs all items within it, and if the chamber is open, you can call up any such item and have it placed in your hand as a full action.</p>	Hybrid	9	12250	L	null	null	null	CRB	227
Prescient Lenses, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>Prescient lenses blend quantum computing and divination magic to model, extrapolate, and display events happening in the next few seconds as translucent holograms. A pair of lenses has one charge, which is refreshed each day, and a creature can benefit from a single use of prescient lenses each day (with any subsequent attempt showing the same few seconds of time as the first daily use). Prescient lenses were originally as optical enhancements for the robotic anacites of Aballon and can be integrated into a robot for the listed price. Alternatively, they can be installed as a cybernetic eye augmentation for 1,000 additional credits.</p>	Hybrid	9	13900	null	null	null	null	PWD	203
Software Imp, Tier 5	<p>Whether or not it has attained true consciousness, a software imp is a perverse and illegal AI obnoxious enough that the question is academic. Software imps come on memory sticks so they remain isolated from your own systems. A software imp has a tier, and it is ineffective on any computer of a higher tier than its own.<br/> You must have access to a computer to install a software imp on it, and you can do so as a full action. The imp renders its memory stick unusable on the way out, leaving no way to conclusively determine what was once stored there. Once installed, the software imp becomes an artificial personality on its host computer. If the computer already has an artificial personality, the imp finds and overwrites it if possible. Faced with an artificial personality to which it does not have access, the imp lies in wait until it gains access to that personality in order to replace it.<br/> Initially, the imp can access information and modules that were accessible to you when you installed the imp. It can gain further access if a user unwittingly uses more access while the imp is installed. The imp can also fool users into giving it more access by attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks with a bonus according to its tier.<br/> While acting as an artificial personality, the imp is as unhelpful as possible to anyone attempting to use the system. The software imp doesn’t ignore commands, but it interprets them in the worst way possible. It can misdirect, reveal unwanted information, obfuscate the truth, and otherwise aggravate and demoralize the user.<br/> Finding and removing a software imp requires a successful Computers check to hack the imp as if it were a computer of its tier. However, the imp copies and installs itself as redundantly as it can, based on its tier number, and it can revive itself so long as a single copy remains. A dismissal spell targeting a computer infested with software imps can remove the malicious AIs as if they were extraplanar creatures, each with a CR equal to its item level and a Will save bonus based on its tier.<br/> The tiers of software imps and the capabilities of each are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	9	12500	null	null	null	null	ARM	124
Soul Projector, Arriver	<p>A soul projector is a bracer of dark stone accented with brassy metal. While you wear the bracer, you are proficient with it, and you can’t be disarmed of it. The bracer counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. Unliving creatures can’t use a soul projector. Each time you attack with a soul projector, it draws forth a tiny bit of your essence to power itself, and you lose a number of Hit Points equal to the number of damage dice the projector deals to your target. This drain of vitality bypasses DR, and the soul projector fails to work if you take no damage. However, if you spend 1 Resolve Point, you can cause the weapon to work without taking this damage. You can use the soul projector to make melee attacks or ranged attacks with a range increment of 60 feet. These attacks target EAC and deal piercing damage that has the force descriptor. A soul projector is also a boost weapon, although boosting the weapon increases the Hit Points the weapon drains from you, with the total amount remaining equal to the total number of damage dice rolled. The amount of damage the weapon deals depends on the model of the soul projector: an arriver deals 3d4 damage (boost 1d4), a returner deals 6d4 (boost 3d4), and an awakener deals 10d4 (boost 5d4). When you score a critical with the weapon, you recover the Hit Points you lost activating the soul projector, as the weapon replaces your spiritual drain with a portion of your target’s spirit. When your character level is within 2 levels of that of the next-highest model of soul projector, you can upgrade the item to its next model. To do so, you must acquire magical ingredients including djezet, mithral, and diamond worth the price of the more powerful soul projector, less 30% of the value of your current projector. You then use the ingredients in a 1-hour ritual to upgrade your soul projector to the higher-level model. You must also pay to upgrade any weapon fusions you wish to keep on the weapon as if transferring each of those fusions to a higher-level weapon.</p>	Hybrid	9	15000	L	null	null	null	DF04	34
Telekinetic Gloves (Worn)	<p>Thin leather gloves that have delicate steel wires running through them, telekinetic gloves allow you to manipulate objects at a distance. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> While you wear the gloves, you can use psychokinetic hand as a spell-like ability at will with a range of up to 30 feet. Once per day, the glove can be used to either use psychokinetic strangulation as a spelllike ability (range 30 feet, duration 2 rounds, save DC = 13 + your key ability score modifier) or attempt to disarm or trip a target within 30 feet of you. To attempt a combat maneuver, roll 1d20 + your level + your key ability score modifier against your target’s KAC + 8. If you succeed at the disarm maneuver, you can bring the object to you, catching it in a hand you have free or allowing it to land in your space. After you use the gloves this way for the first time in a day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to do so again, up to two more times a day. Once you use a given pair of telekinetic gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	9	13500	L	null	null	null	ARM	125
Universal Solvent, Concentrated	<p>Sold in enchanted vials that hold one application each, universal solvent is a magical chemical mixture that can dissolve almost every known substance in the galaxy. (Universal solvent can’t damage creatures.) As a standard action, you can splash universal solvent on an object. If a creature holds or wears the item, you must hit with a melee attack against that creature’s EAC. One application of solvent can cover five objects of light bulk, one object of 1 bulk, or a 5-foot area of a surface. When the solvent’s vial is emptied, it leaves a clean, empty vial with no residue.<br/> Universal solvent dissolves adhesives instantaneously, including the strands released by stickybomb grenades, provided the adhesive is of an item level equal to or lower than the solvent. The solvent also softens objects it coats, suppressing hardness according to the solvent’s type. As a full action, a creature can wipe off an application of universal solvent, ending the solvent’s effect on the cleaned object (but not the object used to clean it).<br/> If an object is exposed to universal solvent for 1 minute, the object takes an amount of damage equal to twice the amount by which the solvent’s hardness suppression exceeded the object’s actual hardness. The solvent then becomes inert and turns to dust, and the object returns to its normal hardness.<br/> Universal solvent comes in the following types.</p>	Hybrid	9	2000	null	null	null	null	ARM	125
Antipathy Unit	<p>An antipathy unit is a large device designed to telepathically repel intruders with a mind-affecting compulsion. When activated, the unit broadcasts a signal that most beings find subtly repulsive without being able to discern why the repulsion is occurring. The field affects an area with a radius of up to 100 feet, which you set. Upon entering the field, a creature feels the urge to leave—to remain in the area, the creature must attempt a DC 19 Will saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot willingly return to the area for 24 hours or until the antipathy unit deactivates. Even if the save succeeds, creatures in the area are uncomfortable, taking a –1 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks while they remain within it. You can use the biometric parameters on an antipathy unit’s controls to exclude creatures from the effect, but unless you have available biometric data that you can input into the unit for specific absent creatures, excluded creatures must be present when the unit is activated. An antipathy unit functions for 24 hours before needing to be recharged for 24 hours. The activation need not be continuous, but any activation consumes 1 hour of the unit’s power.</p>	Hybrid	10	20000	5	null	null	null	DF05	44
Earthbound Anklets (Worn)	<p>Made of industrial ceramic sometimes decorated with precious minerals, earthbound anklets contain an internal matrix of directional, weight, and acceleration sensors. Traditionally, the ceramic is created from soil constituents from the wearer’s home world, and the anklets are a way to carry a piece of that home. (The rarest earthbound anklets contain clay from lost Golarion.) Pragmatically, through quantum entanglement and magical means, earthbound anklets provide you a connection to normal gravity.<br/> While you wear earthbound anklets, you can activate or deactivate them as a standard action. Wearing the active anklets allows you to act as if you’re in standard gravity, ignoring the perils of high gravity and the benefits of low gravity. In zero gravity, you decide a gravitational up and down when you activate the anklets, changing this orientation as a move action. Activating the anklets in zero-g allows you to end the off-kilter condition as part of the same action, and you can then move relative to your subjective up and down as if you were walking on a solid surface.<br/> This standard-gravity effect applies only to you and to objects you hold or wear. If an object, such as a thrown weapon, leaves your possession, it is subjected to the gravity of your environment rather than that provided by the anklets.<br/> The anklets can remain active for up to 1 hour per day. This usage need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once you benefit from a given set of earthbound anklets, you can’t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	10	17000	L	null	null	null	ARM	121
Metal Nitro, Platinum	<p>Introduced into a vehicle’s engine through the vehicle’s control panel, metal nitro comes in magical capsules of soft metal. Unlike technological racing nitrous, which releases more oxygen into an engine’s system to help the fuel burn, metal nitro infuses the vehicle with a burst of magical power.<br/> As a move action, you can crush a capsule of metal nitro into a vehicle’s control panel, which increases the vehicle’s drive speed and full speed for a total of 10 rounds. If the pilot fails to take the race action within 1 round of activating the metal nitro or fails the Piloting check to race from a dead stop, the metal nitro forces the vehicle to move its full speed immediately in an uncontrolled manner. If the Pilot fails the check to race, or the nitro activates in an uncontrolled manner, the pilot and any passengers take bludgeoning damage according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> Metal nitro can be safely used only on a vehicle that has an equal or higher item level. If you use metal nitro of an item level higher than the target vehicle’s, the vehicle takes damage after the pilot races or the vehicle first moves because of the nitro. The amount of damage varies according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> The types of metal nitro and their speed increase, as well as potential passenger and vehicle damage, are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	10	2700	null	null	null	null	ARM	123
Mnemonic Editor, Mk 2	<p>A mnemonic editor consists of a complex series of brain implant injectors, digital harrow deck autoreaders, illusion runes, and virtual-reality programs, all controlled by an enchanted analysis computer and attached to a mobile surgical bed. The network of magic and technology is capable of removing experiences from a patient strapped to the bed over the course of a single 24-hour session. Skills and knowledge can be excised, lessons unlearned and muscle memory altered. Memories are not lost entirely; the patient still recalls what it did during its life, whom it met, and how it felt about the moments it experienced, but the impact of those experiences is subtly altered. The device then creates a new set of experiences—clearly artificial but no less effective—by leaving impressions and implanting new knacks, muscle memory, reflexes, and skills.<br/> If you use a mnemonic editor, you can undo 2 character levels’ worth of decisions about which class levels you took, which feats you selected, how you applied any level-based increases to ability scores, how you assigned new skill ranks, and so on. All decisions you made as a result of advancing over the previous 2 character levels you gained are undone. You then make new selections, including new class levels, feats, skills, and the like, as if you had regained the 2 missing character levels. Go through the normal process of advancing your character through each of these 2 levels.<br/> Each mnemonic editor works only once—the strain on its technology and the consequences of rewriting your past to even this small degree cause it to break down into valueless junk after a single session. Additionally, the alterations made to you render it more difficult for such extraordinary procedures to be effective in the future. A mk 1 mnemonic editor cannot be used on you if you have already benefited from one in the past. However, it is possible to use a more advanced mk 2 model that functions in the same manner, even if you have already used a mk 1 mnemonic editor. Of course, you can only benefit from a mk 2 mnemonic editor once. There exist even more advanced mk 3 and mk 4 models, and each can be used on you once even after you have used a lower-level mnemonic editor, but they are so expensive that they are usually produced only upon request.</p>	Hybrid	10	3000	10	null	null	null	CRB	226
Necrotic Mantle (Worn)	<p>Used by the commanders of the Corpse Fleet to conceal their unliving agents, a necrotic mantle is woven of bioactive fibers that mask the necromantic energies of an undead wearer and convert positive energy into something less harmful to that undead. While wearing a necrotic mantle, if you are undead, you have the aura of a living creature instead of an undead for the purposes of magic or technology that can detect undead. You receive a +4 divine bonus to saves against any spell or effect that targets undead, such as control undead. In addition, if you are undead and fail a saving throw against a spell that both affects only undead creatures and has an ongoing effect (such as control undead), you can attempt a second saving throw after 1 round with the same DC as the first. If you succeed, you gain the same reduction in effect as if your initial saving throw had been successful. Additionally, any effort to determine whether a necrotic mantle you are wearing is a magic or technological item requires the creature making the determination to succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your key ability modifier).<br/> If you are undead and are by or in the area of an effect that restores Hit Points only to living creatures, you regain half the number of Hit Points instead of none. If that effect also damages undead creatures, you take no damage; this does not apply to effects that harm undead without healing living creatures.</p>	Hybrid	10	17000	L	null	null	null	PWD	203
Queller	<p>A queller looks like a simple fire extinguisher and is constantly covered with a thin layer of frost. Three times per day as a standard action, you can use a queller to spray a burst of freezing chemicals in a 15-foot cone that deals 5d8 cold damage to each creature in the area (Reflex DC 15 half) and extinguishes all nonmagical fires in the cone (this ends any burning conditions). Kishalee researchers used similar devices to contain incursions from the Elemental Planes; at the GM’s discretion, other quellers that deal different types of energy damage might exist (though they don’t extinguish fires).</p>	Hybrid	10	18000	1	null	null	null	DS04	45
Remote Surveyor (Worn)	<p>Forbidden from venturing to the Sepres VI’s surface due both to the cultural taboo against doing so and the very real risks associated with it, seprevois—especially members and sympathizers of the Returners—created these handheld devices to remotely explore their planet’s surface. The surveyor features a small dish that transmits and receives a signal to the target, as well as a view screen and speaker that relay the device’s findings to you. The device allows you to employ both the audio and visual versions of clairaudience/ clairvoyance simultaneously at a planetary range once per day, for a maximum duration of 10 minutes.</p>	Hybrid	10	18000	L	null	null	null	DS05	43
Scrambler Gloves, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>Runes and twisting lines crisscross the shimmering surface of scrambler gloves. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> You can touch a creature with these gloves by attempting a melee attack against your target’s EAC. If you hit, the scrambler gloves disrupt the target’s mental faculties, rendering the victim confused and shaken for 1 round if it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the item level + your key ability score modifier), or for 1d3+1 rounds on a failed save. However, when the creature rolls on the confusion table, a result of 51–75 causes the creature to instead be staggered, and on a result of 76–100, the creature is instead staggered and can’t cast spells or activate supernatural abilities. This is a mind-affecting effect.<br/> After you use the gloves, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use them again. The gloves’ type determines how many times they can be used per day and how many Resolve Points you can spend for additional activations per day. Once you use a given pair of scrambler gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	10	18000	L	null	null	null	ARM	124
Swarm Programmer Pill	<p>A Swarm programmer pill is a compact lozenge that contains a paper‑thin sliver of a Swarm programmer’s brain. As a full action, you swallow the tablet and it alters your biology, allowing you to choose one of the following effects. If you use another Swarm programmer pill within 24 hours, you become fatigued. Attempting to use a Swarm programmer pill while you are exhausted does little other than consume the pill. While under the pill’s effects, you attract the attention of Swarm components in the same way weapons that have the Swarm weapon special property do.<br/> <strong>Acidic Ejection:</strong> You gain acid resistance 5 and can launch acid as if part of your body (often the mouth) were a macrergate acid cannon, with which you are considered to be proficient. You are immune to your own acid. These adaptations last 4 hours.<br/> <strong>Alate Form:</strong> You grow a set of diaphanous insectile wings that allow you to fly at a speed 10 feet slower than your land speed. Your flight is an extraordinary ability with average maneuverability. The adaptation also grants you a +5 bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly. The wings function for 2 hours. If you are aloft when the effect ends, you float downward 60 feet per round for 3 rounds. If you fail to land or attain another means to fly by then, you fall as the wings detach. This detachment is uncomfortable but deals you no damage.<br/> If necessary, the wings can integrate with your armor. Once they have, removing your armor ends the effect by causing the wings to detach as above.<br/> <strong>Arolia:</strong> You grow special limb pads that grant you a climb speed 10 feet slower than your land speed. You retain this speed for 12 hours. If necessary, the pads can integrate with your armor, functioning as with the wings of alate form. If you’re climbing when the effect ends, you can still attempt to climb by other means.<br/> <strong>Bravery:</strong> You become inured to fear. For 24 hours, whenever you attempt a saving throw against a fear effect, treat any number you roll on the d20 lower than 8 as 8. In addition, if you fail a saving throw against a fear effect, you can reroll that saving throw once. If you still fail the saving throw, you suffer the fear effect for only half its duration, rounded down to a minimum of 0 rounds.<br/> <strong>Swiftness:</strong> For 12 hours, you gain a 20-foot enhancement bonus to speed in all movement types you have.<br/> <strong>Telepathy:</strong> You gain limited telepathy with a range of 30 feet, like that of a lashunta or shirren. If you already have limited telepathy, the adaptation grants you true telepathy. Either adaptation lasts 12 hours. During this time, you can also cast the 1st-level version of mind thrust as a spell-like ability up to three times.<br/> <strong>Weaponized Arm:</strong> One of your hands grows a macrergate mindspike or macrergate thresherblade, with which you are considered to be proficient. If necessary, the weapon integrates with your armor, functioning as with the wings of alate form. You can’t use the affected hand for other purposes, but neither can you be disarmed of the weapon. This adaptation lasts 4 hours, or until you detach the weapon as a standard action, then the weapon disintegrates.</p>	Hybrid	10	2800	null	null	null	null	A!01	52
Telelocator	<p>A telelocator is a hybrid scanner that you can hold in one hand and activate as a move action if you have limited telepathy or telepathy. Each round, you use a move action to combine your telepathic ability with the scanner. The scanner operates by using blindsense (thought) with a range equal to the range of your limited telepathy or telepathy, as well as sense through (thought) at half that range. Targets appear on the scanner showing their distance and direction from you. A telelocator works on an internal energy source that can power it for 10 minutes per day. Each use, no matter how short, consumes 1 minute of this time. However, a creature that has limited telepathy or telepathy can spend 1 Resolve Point to use personal psychic power to fully recharge the telelocator. The psychic link created by using a given telelocator prevents you from using a different one for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	10	20000	L	null	null	null	DF01	45
Telespectrum Circlet, Mk 2	<p>A telespectrum circlet is a hybrid item that counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. The circlet increases the range of your limited telepathy based on the item’s model number. In addition, the circlet has a number of charges per day based on its model number. As a move action, you can expend one of these charges to use your limited telepathy on any creature that knows a language rather than only those that share a language with you. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. Once the circlet’s charges are expended, you can spend 1 Resolve Point in place of a charge to power the effect. The psychic link created by using a given circlet prevents you from using a different one for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	10	20000	L	null	null	null	DF01	45
Vital Seed, Zeolite	<p>Bioengineered to grow specific chemicals and cellular structures, even those that replicate animal or humanoid flesh, vital seeds come packed in tiny capsules of First World soil to make them grow at alarming speeds. The specific effect depends on the purpose for which the seed was bioengineered. Vital seeds can grow livestock and plants, replace missing organs, and perform many other useful tasks. Some common vital seeds are listed here.</p>	Hybrid	10	5000	null	null	null	null	ARM	125
Void Dust	<p>This powder looks like shimmering iron filings, but void dust is actually nanotech infused with magic antithetical to force effects. As a standard action, you can sprinkle the dust on something within your reach. When you sprinkle the dust on a magical force effect or a personal force field, roll 1d20 + 10 against a DC equal to 11 + the level of the caster or the item that created the force effect. If you succeed, the targeted effect is disrupted. A magical effect either ends, or, if it’s permanent or ongoing, is suppressed for 10 minutes. A personal force field is suppressed for 10 minutes. If you fail, the targeted effect is suppressed for 1 round. The time spent suppressed counts against an effect’s duration, and an item that uses battery charges still consumes those charges while suppressed.<br/> Void dust is sold by the pinch. One pinch affects only one force effect, and the pinch is consumed whether you succeed or fail. This dust isn’t strong enough to affect starship force fields or force effects of a similar scale.</p>	Hybrid	10	2550	null	null	null	null	ARM	126
Adaptive Swarm Mask	<p>An adaptive Swarm mask is made from the exoskeleton plates from the head of a Swarm component. The mask counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. When you take damage of any type while wearing the mask, it reduces the damage by 5. It then ceases to provide that benefit, instead providing damage reduction or energy resistance 5 against the same damage type for 1 minute. The mask remains adapted to the same damage type even if you take a different type of damage. After the duration elapses, the mask becomes unadapted and can adjust to a new damage type. This mask attracts the attention of Swarm components in the same way weapons with the Swarm weapon special property do.</p>	Hybrid	11	24500	L	null	null	null	A!01	52
Animistic Tools, Mk 3	<p>People often have superstitions regarding whether objects have a spirit or intelligence, and animistic tools were made with such beliefs in mind. Each of these tool kits has the power to communicate a user’s intentions to inanimate objects. When you use animistic tools with the appropriate skill and you fail a check, you can use the tool’s magic to reroll the check and take the higher result. In addition, as a move action, you can tap or bang a tool from the kit on a broken object, causing the object to ignore the penalties of being broken for a time. An item can benefit from animistic tools in this way only once per day, causing some engineers to joke that no one likes percussive maintenance.<br/> The model of the tools determines the number of rerolls per day and the time an item ignores the broken condition. Once you use a set of animistic tools, you can’t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	11	22000	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Infiltration Assistant (Worn)	<p>A magical scanner and psychic projector connected to sophisticated 3D mapping software, an infiltration assistant can create sophisticated representational maps of an area you’re in. You wear the scanner on your head or headwear, wirelessly connected to your comm unit or eyewear. The assistant counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in your armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> As a move action while wearing the assistant, you can cause the device to magically ping an area within a 60-foot spherical spread of you. Using this ping, the software creates a 3D reconstruction of the area, which it psychically projects to you and all creatures you consider allies in the affected area. This image adjusts to show each creature where it is in the image. The ping doesn’t sense through most objects, but it can sense through a closed door or window that isn’t airtight, hidden, or otherwise sealed. However, any starmetal in the structure of the door or window blocks this benefit. The ping can detect creatures and objects beyond your line of sight and places them as features on the map. Images of such creatures and objects are sometimes distorted, especially if they’re in motion.<br/> The infiltration assistant grants you and your allies in its area a +5 insight bonus to Perception checks to locate hidden creatures and doors within the mapped area. The bonus to find creatures applies only so long as those creatures remain in the same place.<br/> Creatures with ranks in Mysticism perceive the ping like a barely audible sound that raises goose bumps, and they can attempt a DC 25 Mysticism check to determine that something magical just happened. A creature concentrating on detect magic can sense the ping as a brief flash of magic, and a creature benefitting from arcane sight can see the ping as a literal flash of divination magic.<br/> An infiltration assistant can send out 10 pings per day. Each psychic image it produces lasts 5 rounds. As a move action, you can save the image on your comm unit or a similar device for later reference. This static image can provide you a map of the pinged area later without needing to ping it again, but it provides no bonus to Perception checks.<br/> Using the assistant creates magical resonance in creatures that benefit from it. Any creature that benefits from more than 10 pings in a given day experiences visual anomalies, becoming dazzled until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.</p>	Hybrid	11	28000	L	null	null	null	ARM	122
Mindshield Circlet, Mk 2	<p>When shirrens first arrived in the Chuuva system, they were still plagued by fears that despite the protection of Hylax, they might be forced back into the Swarm, losing all the individuality and freedom of choice they had come to embrace. Researchers explored ways to further insulate the empathic race from the Swarm’s psychic call, ranging from the ineffective to the distasteful to some outright unethical practices. The mindshield circlet is in the center of this gamut, although it has retained some utility beyond the potential it has to prevent Swarm manipulation.<br/> While wearing a mindshield circlet, you can’t use limited telepathy and telepathy, and those using such abilities can’t contact you. In addition, you can cast no spells and use no spell-like abilities that are mind-affecting. Furthermore, it is more difficult to affect you with such abilities, even beneficial ones. The mindshield circlet’s model determines a DC, providing protection against such effects. The creator of an effect must make a check, rolling 1d20 + caster level or CR against the DC to overcome your circlet’s protection and affect you normally.<br/> Even at the height of the shirrens’ collective fear of the Swarm, mindshield circlets were a poor solution, as most shirren found the loss of their telepathic abilities to be too isolating to bear for long. The items retain utility, especially by species that don’t rely on telepathy. Such species have copied the technology and make more use of these protective devices.</p>	Hybrid	11	24500	L	null	null	null	A!03	42
Retrieval Charms, Mk 2	<p>Most retrieval charms are bejeweled decorations, although some are knickknacks that depict popular idols or fictional characters. These items come in a pair, each charm attuned to the other with magically enhanced quantum entanglement. It takes 1 minute to attach a charm to an object, and this object can have no more than 3 bulk. As a move action, you can activate the second charm while holding it, teleporting the first charm and its attached object to you. If you do so, the object instantly appears in hand if you have enough hands free to grasp it. Otherwise, it appears in your space. The attached object teleports to you even if it is worn or carried by another creature. Each set of retrieval charms can be used one time per day.<br/> The charms’ type limits the scale of the teleportation, as follows.</p>	Hybrid	11	26000	L	null	null	null	ARM	124
Software Imp, Tier 6	<p>Whether or not it has attained true consciousness, a software imp is a perverse and illegal AI obnoxious enough that the question is academic. Software imps come on memory sticks so they remain isolated from your own systems. A software imp has a tier, and it is ineffective on any computer of a higher tier than its own.<br/> You must have access to a computer to install a software imp on it, and you can do so as a full action. The imp renders its memory stick unusable on the way out, leaving no way to conclusively determine what was once stored there. Once installed, the software imp becomes an artificial personality on its host computer. If the computer already has an artificial personality, the imp finds and overwrites it if possible. Faced with an artificial personality to which it does not have access, the imp lies in wait until it gains access to that personality in order to replace it.<br/> Initially, the imp can access information and modules that were accessible to you when you installed the imp. It can gain further access if a user unwittingly uses more access while the imp is installed. The imp can also fool users into giving it more access by attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks with a bonus according to its tier.<br/> While acting as an artificial personality, the imp is as unhelpful as possible to anyone attempting to use the system. The software imp doesn’t ignore commands, but it interprets them in the worst way possible. It can misdirect, reveal unwanted information, obfuscate the truth, and otherwise aggravate and demoralize the user.<br/> Finding and removing a software imp requires a successful Computers check to hack the imp as if it were a computer of its tier. However, the imp copies and installs itself as redundantly as it can, based on its tier number, and it can revive itself so long as a single copy remains. A dismissal spell targeting a computer infested with software imps can remove the malicious AIs as if they were extraplanar creatures, each with a CR equal to its item level and a Will save bonus based on its tier.<br/> The tiers of software imps and the capabilities of each are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	11	25000	null	null	null	null	ARM	124
Void Hag Robe	<p>You can wear a void hag’s robes as white carbon skin armor, or the robes can be worn as a cloak or tabard, offering no armor protection. In either case, you can treat the robe as a worn magic item. If you do so, you can use the void hag’s stardust robes special ability. Once you use a given void hag robe, you can’t use another void hag robe for 24 hours. However, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to use the robe’s powers again during the same day, up to a maximum of three times per day.<br/> The robes aboard the Crucible are cursed. If you use the robes as a worn magic item, you are affected as if you are inside a planar barrier. You can still travel to another plane in a larger vehicle, such as a starship entering the Drift, but you can’t travel the planes bodily. The hags on the Crucible placed this curse knowing it would preclude the bearers of their robes from using spells such as plane shift to easily escape the PCs, whose attack the hags foresaw in visions.</p>	Hybrid	11	25000	1	null	null	null	DF06	24
Ablative Insulation, Mk 3	<p>Civilization on Verces exists on the thin line between fiery heat and frozen desolation. Verthani’s unique perspective on the elements led them to develop temperature-sensitive compounds with remarkable properties. Ablative insulation comes in a single-use canister containing enchanted fullerene-based powder. In a process that takes 1 minute, you can spray the contents on a creature to thoroughly coat it with the powder (though it automatically avoids orifices and sensory organs such as the eyes, mouth, and nose). The creature coated gains energy resistance to all energy types (which doesn’t stack with any other source of energy resistance), and the ablative insulation wears away as it prevents damage. The coating lasts for 1 hour if not ablated away sooner. Multiple coatings don’t offer any additional benefit (ignore all but the highest-level coating). Each canister contains enough material to fully cover a single Medium or smaller creature, with any excess wasted. When applied to a Large creature, the insulation provides only half the energy resistance (rounded down) and total points of absorption unless a second canister is used. If applied to a Huge or larger creature, the insulation is wasted without effect.</p>	Hybrid	12	5500	L	null	null	null	PWD	202
Computer Idol, Mk 3	<p>A computer idol is a small statuette that creates a field of good luck during computer use. These figures vary wildly in shape, from religious figures to trivid mascots. When you fail a Computers check, the computer idol allows you to reroll and take the higher result. You must be within 5 feet of your computer idol and able to see it to benefit from it.<br/> A computer idol allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type. Once you benefit from a given computer idol, you can’t benefit from a different one for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	12	34000	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Creator Capsule, Mk 3	<p>Although it appears to be little more than an oblong case full of electronics, a creator capsule is a tiny 3D printer, with a programmable interface and a supply of UPBs stored in an extradimensional space. As a full action, you can connect the creator capsule wirelessly to your comm unit or computer, then command it to print one or more nonmagical personal or technological items. Printing an item requires you to have the plans on the connected device or an infosphere connection through which you can download the blueprints.<br/> A creator capsule takes 1 round to create an item, plus 1 round per bulk of the item above light. No individual printed item can have a bulk greater than 3. The creator capsule consumes itself during the printing process. Although the printer can be stopped as a move action, doing so renders the capsule useless for further printing. An item printed by the creator capsule is of average quality, and it has the statistics of an ordinary item of its type.<br/> Based on its type, a creator capsule has the following cost and level limits on items it creates.</p>	Hybrid	12	38000	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Holding Gloves, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>Holding gloves have copper mesh on the fingertips and forming a concavity on the palm. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> Once per day as a standard action while wearing the gloves, you can use their embedded spell as a spell-like ability. If you hit with a melee attack (including an unarmed strike), you can use the spell from the gloves as a reaction, targeting the same creature the attack hit, without provoking an attack of opportunity. After the first time you cast the spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it again, up to two more times on a given day. Once you use a given pair of holding gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.<br/> The spell imbued in holding gloves depends on their model, as follows.</p>	Hybrid	12	35000	L	null	null	null	ARM	122
Kinetic Converter, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>A kinetic converter, also called a rebound generator or bouncy ball, is a 4-inch spherical generator that can capture incoming energy and magically redirect it. You wear the converter on your body. The converter counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in your armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to its mark number.<br/> If you are the target of an attack, spell, or similar effect that deals you damage while you wear the kinetic converter, you can activate the device as a reaction, provided the effect wasn’t a critical hit. Once activated, the converter disperses the kinetic energy of the attack. Instead of taking damage, you are knocked away from the source of the damage a distance based on the convertor’s type, rounding the damage up to the nearest 5. You can fall prone during this movement to halve the distance you move. If you hit an obstacle before moving the distance the converter threw you, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 foot increment you would have traveled, rounded up to the nearest 10 feet.<br/> This damage conversion protects you against additional effects if those effects relied on the damage you negated. For example, a creature’s poisonous bite can’t poison you without dealing you damage. A kinetic converter protects you only from attacks and similar effects, not from hazards such as lava or extreme gravity. The device works against falling damage, but the conversion hurls you back into the air.<br/> The damage-to-distance conversion rate and daily uses of a kinetic converter are based on its model. Once you benefit from a given kinetic converter, using a different one before 24 hours have passed throws off your sense of balance and you become sickened until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.</p>	Hybrid	12	42000	L	null	null	null	ARM	123
Mind Guardian (Worn)	<p>The microcircuitry contained within this adamantine ring records and magically reinforces your core personality. Once per day when you first come under the control of a mind-affecting effect, such as charm monster or dominate person, you can act normally for the first round of the effect, after which you are staggered for 1d4 rounds and affected by the mind-affecting effect as normal.<br/> You must wear a mind guardian at least 12 hours a day for 7 consecutive days before you can use its ability. After this, if the ring is not worn for 24 hours or longer, the mental patterns collapse and must be reestablished.<br/> The lashuntas of Castrovel devised the mind guardians to protect the less mentally adept against outside control. Android engineers particularly skilled in the construction of self-aware neural networks assisted in the design. While most commonly found as a ring, a mind guardian can take the form of any compact piece of jewelry or personal adornment, but it functions only when in direct contact with the body.</p>	Hybrid	12	36000	null	null	null	null	PWD	202
Psychic Resonator	<p>A psychic resonator amplifies telepathy, allowing long-distance telepathic communication. The resonator doubles the range of limited telepathy and telepathy, affecting creatures on a planetary scale. If you have limited telepathy or telepathy, you can operate the psychic resonator as if it were a comm unit with a system-wide range to send a message to a creature you know. Otherwise, the resonator can send a telepathic broadcast at a much shorter range, such as from the depths of a star to that star’s surface. In any case, if your telepathy is language-dependent, you must still share a language with your target for that target to understand the message. In addition, sources of psychic interference can hamper or block messages sent through a psychic resonator, changing the message’s content, feeling, or both, as well as making the results affect only certain creatures.</p>	Hybrid	12	40000	100	null	null	null	DF05	44
Runeworm	<p>Currently interlaced with the skull and spine of one of Serovox’s defeated foes, this hybrid item appears to be a 24-inch-long metallic centipede covered in runes. When it is placed near your ear (or a similar orifice), it animates and enters your body. Once inside you, the runeworm intertwines with your internal anatomy and releases an arcane virus that rewrites and improves some part of your body’s function. It functions as a mk 2 synergizing symbiote, which is able to increase an ability score by 4. However, it is so advanced that it can instead upgrade any mk 2 personal upgrade already in your system to a mk 3 personal upgrade, increasing the ability score bonus from +4 to +6.</p>	Hybrid	12	37000	null	null	null	null	DS06	30
Captive-Star Amulet, Magnetar (Worn)	<p>The pendant of a captive-star amulet is a miniature containment field that holds magical energy compressed to resemble a tiny star. While you wear the amulet, if a spell includes you as a target, the necklace allows you to use the counter option of dispel magic against that spell as a reaction. You must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + half the amulet’s item level + your key ability score modifier). A captive-star amulet works once per day, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate it a second time during that same day. Once you use a given captive-star amulet, you can’t use a different one for 24 hours.<br/> Captive star amulets come in three types with varying functions.</p>	Hybrid	13	54000	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Eoxian Wrackstaff	<p>Consisting of a long metallic shaft capped with a two-pronged head, an Eoxian wrackstaff is a two-handed basic melee weapon that deals 6d4 bludgeoning damage and has the block weapon special property.

Eyes Of Rhean	<p>Serovox pried this pair of pale sapphire gems from the head of an inevitable they destroyed in a duel. When you hold one of the eyes in one hand, you can control the other as a spy drone that can’t be upgraded. You see what the flying eye sees through the eye you hold. However, if you place the gems over your own eyes, they burrow into your skull and replace two of your eyes (destroying the optic nerves of any additional eyes if you have more than two eyes), functioning as a long-range darkvision capacitors augmentation. You can still send out one eye as a spy drone, during which time the eyes do not grant you darkvision. When the eyes aren’t embedded in a skull and aren’t in use, a reddish mist slowly coalesces around them.</p>	Hybrid	13	55000	L	null	null	null	DS06	30
Null-Space Chamber, Mk 3	<p>A null-space chamber is a circular device often designed to be strapped to an arm or backpack. When you press a button on the side, the device creates a circular extradimensional rift to a pocket space, the size of which is determined by the null-space chamber’s model. You can close it by pressing the button again, causing the entrance to the space to disappear. Anything stored within the space remains, however, traveling with the item. The null-space chamber can be opened and closed only from the outside.<br/> The only air within the pocket space is that which enters when you open the entrance. The device does not accumulate bulk even as its pocket space is filled. Each null-space chamber is associated with its own particular extradimensional space. Each null-space chamber can carry a set amount of bulk, after which it can no longer be closed (even if it has room left for more material). Spells and items that contain or create extradimensional spaces, such as other null-space chambers, do not function within a null-space chamber’s pocket dimension.<br/> A readout on a null-space chamber automatically catalogs all items within it, and if the chamber is open, you can call up any such item and have it placed in your hand as a full action.</p>	Hybrid	13	50000	L	null	null	null	CRB	227

Universal Solvent, Forte	<p>Sold in enchanted vials that hold one application each, universal solvent is a magical chemical mixture that can dissolve almost every known substance in the galaxy. (Universal solvent can’t damage creatures.) As a standard action, you can splash universal solvent on an object. If a creature holds or wears the item, you must hit with a melee attack against that creature’s EAC. One application of solvent can cover five objects of light bulk, one object of 1 bulk, or a 5-foot area of a surface. When the solvent’s vial is emptied, it leaves a clean, empty vial with no residue.<br/> Universal solvent dissolves adhesives instantaneously, including the strands released by stickybomb grenades, provided the adhesive is of an item level equal to or lower than the solvent. The solvent also softens objects it coats, suppressing hardness according to the solvent’s type. As a full action, a creature can wipe off an application of universal solvent, ending the solvent’s effect on the cleaned object (but not the object used to clean it).<br/> If an object is exposed to universal solvent for 1 minute, the object takes an amount of damage equal to twice the amount by which the solvent’s hardness suppression exceeded the object’s actual hardness. The solvent then becomes inert and turns to dust, and the object returns to its normal hardness.<br/> Universal solvent comes in the following types.</p>	Hybrid	13	7500	null	null	null	null	ARM	125
Dimensional Modulator	<p>Suspected to have been left behind by an ancient alien civilization that abandoned its home planet sometime during the Gap, a dimensional modulator looks like an asymmetrical computer with a display depicting several vertical columns of glowing digital runes that continuously morph and shift. The display is attached seamlessly to a cylindrical clockwork engine the approximate size and weight of a fire extinguisher, containing myriad ancient-looking cogs and gears incongruously integrated with more modern parts. A series of tuning forks of varying lengths, which protrude from the top of the apparatus, move when a large mechanical crank affixed to one side is operated. Three times per day as a standard action, you can aim the device at a single creature within 30 feet and turn the crank clockwise five full turns; this requires the use of two hands. This causes the dimensional modulator’s engine to generate bright flashes of energy, the symbols on its display to change rapidly, and the tuning forks to spin, rise, and fall, emanating an eerie tone. The target must then succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be immediately transformed into a two-dimensional creature for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, there is a 50% chance that you are affected by the dimensional modulator instead. You must attempt the same saving throw, but if you fail, you are transformed for 1d6 rounds instead. Any creature that becomes two-dimensional in this way is perfectly flat and thin as paper, as if the creature is an animated painting or living shadow. Any equipment a two-dimensional creature is holding at the time of transformation transforms with the creature. Such a creature can only move and take the combat banter action to speak. They can pass through other creatures’ spaces without provoking attacks of opportunity and can move along ceilings, floors, walls, and other flat surfaces as if affected by spider climb (though they need not have any limbs free to do so) at double their normal land speed. A two-dimensional creature can attempt Perception and Stealth checks, gaining a +10 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks if they move along a wall covered in paintings, graffiti, or other images. A two-dimensional creature can still be the target of attacks, spells, and special abilities, but they gain a +8 circumstance bonus to Armor Class, a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws, and DR 20/magic. If a creature dies while two-dimensional, their image is etched permanently onto the flat surface where they perished. Some believe the aliens who created the dimensional modulators are still alive today, having transformed themselves into creatures perceived in more dimensions than most denizens of the Pact Worlds can comprehend.</p>	Hybrid	14	56000	2	null	null	null	DF04	52
Electroencephalon Command Key	<p>This is Serovox’s electroencephalon (Starfinder Alien Archive 81), as well as the command key for the primary computers of the Empire of Bones. It grants the wielder authorized access to any computer on the ship and can grant another creature authorized for 24 hours. Additionally, the electroencephalon is tied directly to the engines, sensors, and weapons of the ship, allowing anyone holding it to feel the ship as an extension of her own body. A creature holding it gains a +10 circumstance bonus to all skill checks attempted as part of starship combat.</p>	Hybrid	14	75000	1	null	null	null	DS06	35
Metal Nitro, Star	<p>Introduced into a vehicle’s engine through the vehicle’s control panel, metal nitro comes in magical capsules of soft metal. Unlike technological racing nitrous, which releases more oxygen into an engine’s system to help the fuel burn, metal nitro infuses the vehicle with a burst of magical power.<br/> As a move action, you can crush a capsule of metal nitro into a vehicle’s control panel, which increases the vehicle’s drive speed and full speed for a total of 10 rounds. If the pilot fails to take the race action within 1 round of activating the metal nitro or fails the Piloting check to race from a dead stop, the metal nitro forces the vehicle to move its full speed immediately in an uncontrolled manner. If the Pilot fails the check to race, or the nitro activates in an uncontrolled manner, the pilot and any passengers take bludgeoning damage according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> Metal nitro can be safely used only on a vehicle that has an equal or higher item level. If you use metal nitro of an item level higher than the target vehicle’s, the vehicle takes damage after the pilot races or the vehicle first moves because of the nitro. The amount of damage varies according to the type of metal nitro.<br/> The types of metal nitro and their speed increase, as well as potential passenger and vehicle damage, are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	14	10800	null	null	null	null	ARM	123
Mindlink Circlet, Mk 3	<p>Although items with powers similar to those of the mindlink circlet have existed in the Pact Worlds for thousands of years, the technological components of the this useful item were an innovation that made its powers readily available.

Prescient Lenses, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>Prescient lenses blend quantum computing and divination magic to model, extrapolate, and display events happening in the next few seconds as translucent holograms. A pair of lenses has one charge, which is refreshed each day, and a creature can benefit from a single use of prescient lenses each day (with any subsequent attempt showing the same few seconds of time as the first daily use). Prescient lenses were originally as optical enhancements for the robotic anacites of Aballon and can be integrated into a robot for the listed price. Alternatively, they can be installed as a cybernetic eye augmentation for 1,000 additional credits.</p>	Hybrid	14	77000	null	null	null	null	PWD	203
Scrambler Gloves, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>Runes and twisting lines crisscross the shimmering surface of scrambler gloves. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> You can touch a creature with these gloves by attempting a melee attack against your target’s EAC. If you hit, the scrambler gloves disrupt the target’s mental faculties, rendering the victim confused and shaken for 1 round if it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the item level + your key ability score modifier), or for 1d3+1 rounds on a failed save. However, when the creature rolls on the confusion table, a result of 51–75 causes the creature to instead be staggered, and on a result of 76–100, the creature is instead staggered and can’t cast spells or activate supernatural abilities. This is a mind-affecting effect.<br/> After you use the gloves, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use them again. The gloves’ type determines how many times they can be used per day and how many Resolve Points you can spend for additional activations per day. Once you use a given pair of scrambler gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	14	73000	L	null	null	null	ARM	124
Erasure Worm	<p>This 3-inch-long plastic tube contains an array of sentient magical computer code suspended in a gel. When the gel is squeezed directly onto a computer terminal, the code coalesces into a finger-length worm made of light. As a standard action, you can tell the worm a name or description of a person, place, thing, or event you would like it to erase. The worm then rapidly makes its way into the computer’s system, attempting to corrupt or delete any information regarding the name or description it was given.<br/> If the computer system it is released into doesn’t have access to this information or root access, the erasure worm sits dormant until any user unlocks the system and gains access. The worm then usurps the access and starts erasing any data it finds that matches its target description. If the computer infected with an erasure worm connects to any other computer, including through an infosphere, the worm travels to that computer once it has deleted all target information on its current computer.<br/> An erasure worm can function for up to 30 days before the magic that binds it dissipates. It takes the worm 1 minute to erase all target data on a single computer system, 1 day to erase all target data on most large networks, and 2d6 days to erase all target data on most infospheres. If the gel is squeezed from the tube onto any other surface or object, it immediately becomes inert and evaporates in 1 hour.<br/> The existence of an erasure worm in a computer system can be discovered with a successful DC 41 Computers check and can be eliminated with two consecutive successful opposed Computers checks; an erasure worm has a total Computers bonus of +31. Each opposed check takes 1 minute, and while it is battling in this way, the erasure worm isn’t eliminating data.</p>	Hybrid	15	110000	null	null	null	null	3C02	45
Hivejack, Mk 3	<p>During the combined efforts of the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds to repel attacks from the Swarm, an enterprising research team composed mostly of shirren and vesk mechanics developed the first hivejack to allow a user to “hack” into the hive mind of the Swarm in an effort to detect and manipulate the thoughts of individual Swarm components. A hivejack consists of a pair of small spherical applicators that are placed just above or below your visual sensors; it takes an uninterrupted 24 hours for the item to adjust to your mental patterns before you can use it. Each applicator is connected to a long, wispy tendril that lies flat upon your head or dangles from your face; this tendril taps into the Swarm’s hive mind through replicating specific pheromones, electrostatic fields, and psychic signals while, at the same time, blocking your own thoughts from the hive mind. Creatures with racial telepathy cannot use a hivejack. These items have not seen much use since the invasion, however, as prolonged use the technology leaves you vulnerable to being dominated by the Swarm hive mind. The effects of a hivejack depend on its model, as described below.</p>	Hybrid	15	108000	L	null	null	null	DF04	52
Mindshield Circlet, Mk 3	<p>When shirrens first arrived in the Chuuva system, they were still plagued by fears that despite the protection of Hylax, they might be forced back into the Swarm, losing all the individuality and freedom of choice they had come to embrace. Researchers explored ways to further insulate the empathic race from the Swarm’s psychic call, ranging from the ineffective to the distasteful to some outright unethical practices. The mindshield circlet is in the center of this gamut, although it has retained some utility beyond the potential it has to prevent Swarm manipulation.<br/> While wearing a mindshield circlet, you can’t use limited telepathy and telepathy, and those using such abilities can’t contact you. In addition, you can cast no spells and use no spell-like abilities that are mind-affecting. Furthermore, it is more difficult to affect you with such abilities, even beneficial ones. The mindshield circlet’s model determines a DC, providing protection against such effects. The creator of an effect must make a check, rolling 1d20 + caster level or CR against the DC to overcome your circlet’s protection and affect you normally.<br/> Even at the height of the shirrens’ collective fear of the Swarm, mindshield circlets were a poor solution, as most shirren found the loss of their telepathic abilities to be too isolating to bear for long. The items retain utility, especially by species that don’t rely on telepathy. Such species have copied the technology and make more use of these protective devices.</p>	Hybrid	15	107000	L	null	null	null	A!03	42
Mnemonic Editor, Mk 3	<p>A mnemonic editor consists of a complex series of brain implant injectors, digital harrow deck autoreaders, illusion runes, and virtual-reality programs, all controlled by an enchanted analysis computer and attached to a mobile surgical bed. The network of magic and technology is capable of removing experiences from a patient strapped to the bed over the course of a single 24-hour session. Skills and knowledge can be excised, lessons unlearned and muscle memory altered. Memories are not lost entirely; the patient still recalls what it did during its life, whom it met, and how it felt about the moments it experienced, but the impact of those experiences is subtly altered. The device then creates a new set of experiences—clearly artificial but no less effective—by leaving impressions and implanting new knacks, muscle memory, reflexes, and skills.<br/> If you use a mnemonic editor, you can undo 2 character levels’ worth of decisions about which class levels you took, which feats you selected, how you applied any level-based increases to ability scores, how you assigned new skill ranks, and so on. All decisions you made as a result of advancing over the previous 2 character levels you gained are undone. You then make new selections, including new class levels, feats, skills, and the like, as if you had regained the 2 missing character levels. Go through the normal process of advancing your character through each of these 2 levels.<br/> Each mnemonic editor works only once—the strain on its technology and the consequences of rewriting your past to even this small degree cause it to break down into valueless junk after a single session. Additionally, the alterations made to you render it more difficult for such extraordinary procedures to be effective in the future. A mk 1 mnemonic editor cannot be used on you if you have already benefited from one in the past. However, it is possible to use a more advanced mk 2 model that functions in the same manner, even if you have already used a mk 1 mnemonic editor. Of course, you can only benefit from a mk 2 mnemonic editor once. There exist even more advanced mk 3 and mk 4 models, and each can be used on you once even after you have used a lower-level mnemonic editor, but they are so expensive that they are usually produced only upon request.</p>	Hybrid	15	20000	10	null	null	null	CRB	226
Retrieval Charms, Mk 3	<p>Most retrieval charms are bejeweled decorations, although some are knickknacks that depict popular idols or fictional characters. These items come in a pair, each charm attuned to the other with magically enhanced quantum entanglement. It takes 1 minute to attach a charm to an object, and this object can have no more than 3 bulk. As a move action, you can activate the second charm while holding it, teleporting the first charm and its attached object to you. If you do so, the object instantly appears in hand if you have enough hands free to grasp it. Otherwise, it appears in your space. The attached object teleports to you even if it is worn or carried by another creature. Each set of retrieval charms can be used one time per day.<br/> The charms’ type limits the scale of the teleportation, as follows.</p>	Hybrid	15	105000	L	null	null	null	ARM	124
Software Imp, Tier 8	<p>Whether or not it has attained true consciousness, a software imp is a perverse and illegal AI obnoxious enough that the question is academic. Software imps come on memory sticks so they remain isolated from your own systems. A software imp has a tier, and it is ineffective on any computer of a higher tier than its own.<br/> You must have access to a computer to install a software imp on it, and you can do so as a full action. The imp renders its memory stick unusable on the way out, leaving no way to conclusively determine what was once stored there. Once installed, the software imp becomes an artificial personality on its host computer. If the computer already has an artificial personality, the imp finds and overwrites it if possible. Faced with an artificial personality to which it does not have access, the imp lies in wait until it gains access to that personality in order to replace it.<br/> Initially, the imp can access information and modules that were accessible to you when you installed the imp. It can gain further access if a user unwittingly uses more access while the imp is installed. The imp can also fool users into giving it more access by attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks with a bonus according to its tier.<br/> While acting as an artificial personality, the imp is as unhelpful as possible to anyone attempting to use the system. The software imp doesn’t ignore commands, but it interprets them in the worst way possible. It can misdirect, reveal unwanted information, obfuscate the truth, and otherwise aggravate and demoralize the user.<br/> Finding and removing a software imp requires a successful Computers check to hack the imp as if it were a computer of its tier. However, the imp copies and installs itself as redundantly as it can, based on its tier number, and it can revive itself so long as a single copy remains. A dismissal spell targeting a computer infested with software imps can remove the malicious AIs as if they were extraplanar creatures, each with a CR equal to its item level and a Will save bonus based on its tier.<br/> The tiers of software imps and the capabilities of each are as follows.</p>	Hybrid	15	100000	null	null	null	null	ARM	124
Soul Projector, Returner	<p>A soul projector is a bracer of dark stone accented with brassy metal. While you wear the bracer, you are proficient with it, and you can’t be disarmed of it. The bracer counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. Unliving creatures can’t use a soul projector. Each time you attack with a soul projector, it draws forth a tiny bit of your essence to power itself, and you lose a number of Hit Points equal to the number of damage dice the projector deals to your target. This drain of vitality bypasses DR, and the soul projector fails to work if you take no damage. However, if you spend 1 Resolve Point, you can cause the weapon to work without taking this damage. You can use the soul projector to make melee attacks or ranged attacks with a range increment of 60 feet. These attacks target EAC and deal piercing damage that has the force descriptor. A soul projector is also a boost weapon, although boosting the weapon increases the Hit Points the weapon drains from you, with the total amount remaining equal to the total number of damage dice rolled. The amount of damage the weapon deals depends on the model of the soul projector: an arriver deals 3d4 damage (boost 1d4), a returner deals 6d4 (boost 3d4), and an awakener deals 10d4 (boost 5d4). When you score a critical with the weapon, you recover the Hit Points you lost activating the soul projector, as the weapon replaces your spiritual drain with a portion of your target’s spirit. When your character level is within 2 levels of that of the next-highest model of soul projector, you can upgrade the item to its next model. To do so, you must acquire magical ingredients including djezet, mithral, and diamond worth the price of the more powerful soul projector, less 30% of the value of your current projector. You then use the ingredients in a 1-hour ritual to upgrade your soul projector to the higher-level model. You must also pay to upgrade any weapon fusions you wish to keep on the weapon as if transferring each of those fusions to a higher-level weapon.</p>	Hybrid	15	120000	L	null	null	null	DF04	34
Kinetic Converter, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>A kinetic converter, also called a rebound generator or bouncy ball, is a 4-inch spherical generator that can capture incoming energy and magically redirect it. You wear the converter on your body. The converter counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in your armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to its mark number.<br/> If you are the target of an attack, spell, or similar effect that deals you damage while you wear the kinetic converter, you can activate the device as a reaction, provided the effect wasn’t a critical hit. Once activated, the converter disperses the kinetic energy of the attack. Instead of taking damage, you are knocked away from the source of the damage a distance based on the convertor’s type, rounding the damage up to the nearest 5. You can fall prone during this movement to halve the distance you move. If you hit an obstacle before moving the distance the converter threw you, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 foot increment you would have traveled, rounded up to the nearest 10 feet.<br/> This damage conversion protects you against additional effects if those effects relied on the damage you negated. For example, a creature’s poisonous bite can’t poison you without dealing you damage. A kinetic converter protects you only from attacks and similar effects, not from hazards such as lava or extreme gravity. The device works against falling damage, but the conversion hurls you back into the air.<br/> The damage-to-distance conversion rate and daily uses of a kinetic converter are based on its model. Once you benefit from a given kinetic converter, using a different one before 24 hours have passed throws off your sense of balance and you become sickened until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.</p>	Hybrid	16	172000	L	null	null	null	ARM	123
Telespectrum Circlet, Mk 3	<p>A telespectrum circlet is a hybrid item that counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. The circlet increases the range of your limited telepathy based on the item’s model number. In addition, the circlet has a number of charges per day based on its model number. As a move action, you can expend one of these charges to use your limited telepathy on any creature that knows a language rather than only those that share a language with you. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. Once the circlet’s charges are expended, you can spend 1 Resolve Point in place of a charge to power the effect. The psychic link created by using a given circlet prevents you from using a different one for 24 hours.</p>	Hybrid	16	160000	L	null	null	null	DF01	45
Captive-Star Amulet, Pulsar (Worn)	<p>The pendant of a captive-star amulet is a miniature containment field that holds magical energy compressed to resemble a tiny star. While you wear the amulet, if a spell includes you as a target, the necklace allows you to use the counter option of dispel magic against that spell as a reaction. You must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + half the amulet’s item level + your key ability score modifier). A captive-star amulet works once per day, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate it a second time during that same day. Once you use a given captive-star amulet, you can’t use a different one for 24 hours.<br/> Captive star amulets come in three types with varying functions.</p>	Hybrid	17	270000	L	null	null	null	ARM	120
Null-Space Chamber, Mk 4	<p>A null-space chamber is a circular device often designed to be strapped to an arm or backpack. When you press a button on the side, the device creates a circular extradimensional rift to a pocket space, the size of which is determined by the null-space chamber’s model. You can close it by pressing the button again, causing the entrance to the space to disappear. Anything stored within the space remains, however, traveling with the item. The null-space chamber can be opened and closed only from the outside.<br/> The only air within the pocket space is that which enters when you open the entrance. The device does not accumulate bulk even as its pocket space is filled. Each null-space chamber is associated with its own particular extradimensional space. Each null-space chamber can carry a set amount of bulk, after which it can no longer be closed (even if it has room left for more material). Spells and items that contain or create extradimensional spaces, such as other null-space chambers, do not function within a null-space chamber’s pocket dimension.<br/> A readout on a null-space chamber automatically catalogs all items within it, and if the chamber is open, you can call up any such item and have it placed in your hand as a full action.</p>	Hybrid	17	250000	L	null	null	null	CRB	227

Universal Solvent, Regia	<p>Sold in enchanted vials that hold one application each, universal solvent is a magical chemical mixture that can dissolve almost every known substance in the galaxy. (Universal solvent can’t damage creatures.) As a standard action, you can splash universal solvent on an object. If a creature holds or wears the item, you must hit with a melee attack against that creature’s EAC. One application of solvent can cover five objects of light bulk, one object of 1 bulk, or a 5-foot area of a surface. When the solvent’s vial is emptied, it leaves a clean, empty vial with no residue.<br/> Universal solvent dissolves adhesives instantaneously, including the strands released by stickybomb grenades, provided the adhesive is of an item level equal to or lower than the solvent. The solvent also softens objects it coats, suppressing hardness according to the solvent’s type. As a full action, a creature can wipe off an application of universal solvent, ending the solvent’s effect on the cleaned object (but not the object used to clean it).<br/> If an object is exposed to universal solvent for 1 minute, the object takes an amount of damage equal to twice the amount by which the solvent’s hardness suppression exceeded the object’s actual hardness. The solvent then becomes inert and turns to dust, and the object returns to its normal hardness.<br/> Universal solvent comes in the following types.</p>	Hybrid	17	36000	null	null	null	null	ARM	125

Energy-Matter Gateway	<p>An inert energy-matter gateway is a black cube composed of aligned tubes. When you activate the gateway as a standard action, you designate creatures that can benefit from it. The cube’s tubes realign 1 round later to form a 10-foot-tall, hollow monolith that glows with an untapped power. Once active, an energy-matter gateway creates a magical field in a 60-foot-radius spread. An energy-matter gateway can be deactivated as a move action, whereupon it folds back up into its cubic form.<br/> A designated creature within the magical field of an activated energy-matter gateway can spend 1 Resolve Point to tap into the gateway’s field for 1 minute. If such a creature uses a weapon that consumes standard ammunition, the monolith magically produces the ammunition as it’s used. When a creature is tapped into the field, its battery-operated equipment consumes no charges.</p>	Hybrid	19	600000	4	null	null	null	ARM	121

The bracer counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. Unliving creatures can’t use a soul projector. Each time you attack with a soul projector, it draws forth a tiny bit of your essence to power itself, and you lose a number of Hit Points equal to the number of damage dice the projector deals to your target. This drain of vitality bypasses DR, and the soul projector fails to work if you take no damage. However, if you spend 1 Resolve Point, you can cause the weapon to work without taking this damage. You can use the soul projector to make melee attacks or ranged attacks with a range increment of 60 feet. These attacks target EAC and deal piercing damage that has the force descriptor. A soul projector is also a boost weapon, although boosting the weapon increases the Hit Points the weapon drains from you, with the total amount remaining equal to the total number of damage dice rolled. The amount of damage the weapon deals depends on the model of the soul projector: an arriver deals 3d4 damage (boost 1d4), a returner deals 6d4 (boost 3d4), and an awakener deals 10d4 (boost 5d4). When you score a critical with the weapon, you recover the Hit Points you lost activating the soul projector, as the weapon replaces your spiritual drain with a portion of your target’s spirit. When your character level is within 2 levels of that of the next-highest model of soul projector, you can upgrade the item to its next model. To do so, you must acquire magical ingredients including djezet, mithral, and diamond worth the price of the more powerful soul projector, less 30% of the value of your current projector. You then use the ingredients in a 1-hour ritual to upgrade your soul projector to the higher-level model. You must also pay to upgrade any weapon fusions you wish to keep on the weapon as if transferring each of those fusions to a higher-level weapon.</p>	Hybrid	20	900000	L	null	null	null	DF04	34
Aerosol Spray	<p>Aerosol spray is an opaque liquid stored at high pressure with compressed gas in a spray canister. As a standard action, you can depress the canister’s trigger to spray the aerosol in a 5-foot burst, which fills a single square adjacent to your space. You can see any hidden or invisible laser beams in the aerosolfilled square, and you immediately become aware of the location of any invisible creature in that square. In addition, invisible creatures have only concealment (rather than total concealment) as long as they remain in an aerosol-filled square. The aerosol remains in its square for 1d4+1 rounds before dissipating. Each canister of aerosol spray contains enough aerosol for 10 uses.</p>	Personal	1	80	L	null	null	null	ARM	128

Bonding Epoxy	<p>Bonding epoxy is a two-part adhesive plastic kept in a handheld dispenser that automatically mixes the components as they are dispensed. A single dispenser can be used five times. The dispensers cannot be reloaded, and a new dispenser must be purchased if additional epoxy is desired.<br/> As a full action you can coat up to a 1-square-foot area with the epoxy. Anything held against the area bonds to it over 1d4 rounds as the epoxy dries. This requires a full action each round to maintain contact between the objects, and anything resisting (such as a creature) must be pinned or helpless to be held in place during this drying period. Dispensed epoxy that is not used within 1 minute hardens and loses its ability to bond objects together.<br/> Pulling apart objects bonded together with this epoxy requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. If the objects are carefully fitted together (requiring 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Engineering check), the Strength DC to separate them increases to 25.</p>	Personal	1	400	L	null	null	null	CRB	230

Culinary Synthesizer, Mk 1	<p>This marvel of modern culinary preparation is a small cube with a control panel on one side and a hatch on another. Using chemical reactions combined with high pressures, a culinary synthesizer converts UPBs into edible foodstuffs, allowing you to craft normal food and drink without using the Life Science skill. Culinary synthesizers are the source of much of the mass-produced food consumed in the Pact Worlds.<br/> A culinary synthesizer comes preprogrammed with a variety of simple meals. You enter the type of meal you want into the synthesizer’s control panel and add an amount of UPBs equal to the meal’s price into the cube’s transformation chamber; the synthesizer reconstructs the UPBs into the desired meal. More advanced culinary synthesizers can be programmed to create intoxicants and other food products (such as field rations and R2Es), as well as individual foodstuffs and ingredients, including analogues of animal products, vegetable products, spices, and more; this requires a number of UPBs equal to the final price of the food product or ingredient. You can then combine these foodstuffs and ingredients into full meals using the craft food or drink task of the Life Science skill.<br/> A culinary synthesizer is a technological item that is usually plugged in to draw power from the local energy grid, but most models come equipped with a manual turn crank that enables them to function when not connected to an external energy source. A culinary synthesizer plugged into an energy grid can create a number of meals (or individual food products) equal to its level in 1 minute. When you power it using the turn crank, a synthesizer can convert 1 UPB into food for each minute that it is cranked.<br/> The quality of food and meals a synthesizer can create depends on its model, as described below (see page 233 of the Core Rulebook for more information on food and drink).</p>	Personal	1	400	1	null	null	null	ARM	129

Affixing a gear clamp in place is a full action, but any object easily and conveniently held in one hand can be added to or removed from a gear clamp as easily as drawing or sheathing a weapon. Gear clamps are designed to have a trick release, with thousands of models each using a unique combination of clicks, spins, tugs, and twists to release attached gear. If you are not familiar with a specific clamps trick (by reading the instructions when you buy the clamp, having it demonstrated, or owning it and periodically testing its function), adding or removing equipment takes a full action.

Culinary Synthesizer, Mk 2	<p>This marvel of modern culinary preparation is a small cube with a control panel on one side and a hatch on another.

Culinary synthesizers are the source of much of the mass-produced food consumed in the Pact Worlds.<br/> A culinary synthesizer comes preprogrammed with a variety of simple meals. You enter the type of meal you want into the synthesizer’s control panel and add an amount of UPBs equal to the meal’s price into the cube’s transformation chamber; the synthesizer reconstructs the UPBs into the desired meal. More advanced culinary synthesizers can be programmed to create intoxicants and other food products (such as field rations and R2Es), as well as individual foodstuffs and ingredients, including analogues of animal products, vegetable products, spices, and more; this requires a number of UPBs equal to the final price of the food product or ingredient. You can then combine these foodstuffs and ingredients into full meals using the craft food or drink task of the Life Science skill.<br/> A culinary synthesizer is a technological item that is usually plugged in to draw power from the local energy grid, but most models come equipped with a manual turn crank that enables them to function when not connected to an external energy source. A culinary synthesizer plugged into an energy grid can create a number of meals (or individual food products) equal to its level in 1 minute. When you power it using the turn crank, a synthesizer can convert 1 UPB into food for each minute that it is cranked.<br/> The quality of food and meals a synthesizer can create depends on its model, as described below (see page 233 of the Core Rulebook for more information on food and drink).</p>	Personal	3	1200	1	null	null	null	ARM	129

Aeon Stones, Clear Spindle	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	1	245	null	null	null	null	CRB	222

When you are within 60 feet of a being with another encryption tattoo and activate your encryption tattoo with a code word as a move action, your tattoo becomes visible for 1 minute and glows faintly. The tattoo closely resembles the glowing circuit patterns prevalent on android skin, and is therefore particularly obvious on non-androids. The agent encryption tattoo is the standard type of encryption tattoo. Certain encryption tattoos, when activated with a different code word, also grant you damage reduction: operative encryption tattoos provide DR 5/—, provocateur encryption tattoos provide DR 10/—, and master encryption tattoos provide DR 15/—. This damage reduction doesn’t stack with any damage reduction you already have. The damage reduction lasts for the 1 minute your tattoo is visible.<br/> Although there is no limit on the number of times you can cause your encryption tattoo to appear, you can activate its power to gain DR only once per day.<br/> An encryption tattoo doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered.

Serum Of Hibernation, Diluted	<p>Scientists studying the hibernation-adapted flora native to Gluun isolated enzymes and compounds that aided in the species’ long sleep.

Most who use this serum do so to make long-distance spaceflight more tolerable or efficient, especially when moving large groups with limited space and resources.<br/> Upon drinking a serum of hibernation, you can allow yourself to fall into a deathlike trance for a time that depends on the potency of the serum. While in this hibernation, you need not eat, drink, or breathe. You awaken if you take damage or if anyone uses a medkit or more advanced medical technology to rouse you and succeeds at a DC 15 Medicine check. If roused before the duration ends, unless the Medicine check to rouse you succeeds by 10 or more, you suffer 1 temporary negative level and are exhausted. Anyone interacting with your hibernating body can tell you are alive with a successful DC 25 Perception check, but someone performing a medical exam can determine your condition with a successful DC 15 Medicine check.</p>	Magic	1	80	null	null	null	null	A!03	43
Spell Gem, 0	<p>Consisting of one or more lattices of carefully arranged lines of rare metal and bits of precious stone in a silicon casing, each lattice in a spell gem is encoded with magical writings equivalent to the casting of a single, specific spell. Holding a spell gem in your hand unlocks little-used portions of your mind, granting you the ability to temporarily cast the spell encoded within the gem without using up your daily spell slots. You must hold the spell gem in your hand throughout the spell’s casting time and must spend at least a standard action using the spell gem, even if the spell’s casting time is shorter. Each spell stored within a spell gem can be cast only once, after which the magic encoded within the spell gem’s lattice is forever expended.<br/> Only spellcasters are capable of using spell gems—if you aren’t a spellcaster, you’re unable to make use of the knowledge that the gem unlocks. You don’t need to know the spell within a spell gem to use it, but the spell must be on your class’s spell list (or have otherwise been added to your spell list) and you must have a high enough key ability score to cast it. If the spell gem’s item level is higher than your caster level, once you’ve spent the full casting time of the spell, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the spell gem’s item level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell remains within the gem and you can attempt to use it again.<br/> To craft a spell gem, you have to know the spell you’re encoding into the gem. If a spell requires expensive materials as part of its casting (such as raise dead), you must provide those while crafting the gem, and the gem’s price is increased by the price of the components. You can create larger, compound spell gems with multiple spells in multiple lattices, with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it.

For 1 hour after you drink sun bean ice, you treat hot environments as if they were one step lower (very hot to normal, severe heat to very hot, and extreme heat to severe heat). This has no effect on heat exposure due to direct contact, such as by touching lava or boiling water. During this duration, you do not suffer from heatstroke if you take damage from heat exposure, and if you are already suffering from heatstroke when you drink a sun bean ice, you can immediately attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw to end the heatstroke. Drinking multiple servings of sun bean ice increases the duration, but the effects do not stack.</p>	Magic	1	80	L	null	null	null	DF02	41

Cover Seed	<p>About 3 inches in diameter, a typical cover seed looks like a large walnut. The Xenowardens deployed the first cover seeds, but the device now sees widespread application and equally diverse appearances.<br/> As a move action, you can squeeze the seed to activate it and hold it or drop it in a square within your reach. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can squeeze and throw the seed (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a square (AC 5). At the end of the turn in which you activated the seed, it sprouts into thick vines in the square it’s in as well as 2 squares of your choice adjacent to the first. These vines form a wall 5 feet high and thick enough to provide cover to creatures in or near them. The vines’ area is difficult terrain.<br/> A cover seed’s vines last and renew themselves for 10 rounds; if the seed lands on a surface made of a material in which plants can’t normally grow, the vines last only 5 rounds.

Spell Ampoules, 0	<p>Spell ampoules are injectable magic, where the essence of a magic spell has been condensed into a liquid form and prepared for injection into a creature. Known colloquially as “spell amps,” these heady, ready-to-use magic injections can be used only once. A spell amp duplicates the effect of a beneficial spell (a spell with “harmless” in its Saving Throw or Spell Resistance entry), excluding divination spells or spells that create some link between the caster and the target. In addition, the spell must be 3rd level or lower, have a casting time of 1 minute or less, and target one or more creatures (but not spells that target just the spellcaster). If a spell targets both creatures and objects, it only affects creatures when used as a spell amp. If a spell requires expending a Resolve Point to cast, it also requires the user to spend a Resolve Point when used as a spell amp (if you choose not to spend a Resolve Point or don’t have any Resolve Points remaining, the spell amp has no effect). A spell amp always has an item level equal to three times the level of the spell it duplicates (treat as a 2nd-level item for spell amps with 0-level spells), and a caster level equal to its item level. Creating a spell ampoule has the same requirements as creating a spell gem (see below). You can only use a spell ampoule on yourself or a willing or unconscious creature. Injecting yourself or a willing creature with a spell ampoule is a standard action, while injecting an unconscious creature is a full action. Spell amps take effect as if the spell had been cast upon the creature injected. When you are injected with a spell amp, you get to make any decisions about the spell’s effect as if you were the caster of the spell— you are both the effective target and the caster of the effect.</p>	Magic	2	200	L	null	null	null	CRB	224

They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	3	1300	null	null	null	null	AT02	44

Amulet Of Camouflage (Worn)	<p>This modest amulet projects a simple pattern over your outer layers of armor, clothing, and equipment, which helps you blend into the background. When in an environment with a maximum distance at which Perception checks can be attempted, rolls to see at what range other creatures can attempt Perception checks against you are rolled twice, and the lower result applies. See Chapter 11 for more information on the Perception ranges of different environments. The amulet’s magic isn’t powerful enough to make you invisible or grant a bonus to Stealth checks. You can activate or deactivate this camouflage as a standard action.</p>	Magic	3	1400	null	null	null	null	CRB	223
Brigh’S Bolt	<p>This simple, shiny metal bolt is the size of a thumbnail and has an image of a tiny gear on its head. As a full action, you can affix a Brigh’s bolt to a broken suit of armor, tool, vehicle, or weapon to negate the penalties of the broken condition for as long as the bolt is affixed. The bolt does not repair any damage sustained by the object and the object is still visibly damaged, so its resale value is reduced as normal for a broken item. If the item is repaired so as to no longer have the broken condition, the Brigh’s bolt falls off; otherwise, it can be removed as a full action. If an item to which a Brigh’s bolt is attached is destroyed, the bolt is also destroyed.</p>	Magic	3	1300	null	null	null	null	PWD	200
Elemental Gem, Mk 1	<p>Each elemental gem contains one elemental from a specific elemental plane. The gem’s color indicates the sort of elemental contained within—air gems are transparent, earth gems are brown, fire gems are orange, and water gems are blue. As a standard action, you can crush the gem, destroying it. The contained elemental then appears as if you had cast a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144) of a level and caster level according to the gem’s type.</p>	Magic	3	250	L	null	null	null	ARM	112
Falsebond Tattoos	<p>A falsebond tattoo is designed to specifically mimic the partner bond between a dragonkin creature and a non-dragonkin creature, such as that experienced between many members of the Skyfire Legion. Falsebond tattoos come in pairs (with matching designs) and must be purchased and applied at the same time; the listed price is for two tattoos. The tattoos can be applied to any nonmindless creature regardless of its type. Once applied, a mystical link is formed between the recipients of the two tattoos. These creatures can communicate with each other as if they had telepathy with a range of 100 feet. In addition, once per day, linked creatures that are within 30 feet of each other can roll initiative checks separately and treat the higher result as the result for both of them. However, when the creatures use this benefit, their brainwaves become so in sync that they might be overwhelmed with sensory information; each creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or gain the off-target condition for 1 round. A falsebond tattoo doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered. Most dragonkin, ryphorians, and members of the Skyfire Legion view these tattoos as perversions of a sacred bond and, at the GM’s discretion, a character wearing a falsebond tattoo takes a –4 circumstance penalty to Diplomacy checks when interacting with such individuals. You can attempt to hide a falsebond tattoo with a Disguise check opposed by any onlookers’ Perception checks; this counts as altering a minor detail (Core Rulebook 140).</p>	Magic	3	1500	null	null	null	null	DF04	49
Glossy Brenneri Stone	<p>This small, smooth stone glows with a pale light that sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius around you. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes focusing on the brenneri stone to gain an additional effect; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. After you use the stone, the radius of its light effect is reduced to 5 feet for 24 hours. You can gain the benefits of only one brenneri stone per day. Brenneris can use their favored object racial trait with a brenneri stone and gain the benefits of both the item and the class feature.</p>	Magic	3	1000	null	null	null	null	AA3	9
Gravity Serum	<p>Gravity serum is a combination of hashukayak hormones and proteins that have been magically stabilized and adapted for use by a wide variety of life-forms. For 1 hour after you consume a gravity serum, you treat your Strength as 4 higher for the purposes of determining how much you can carry. Furthermore, while in an area of high gravity, you can move at three-quarters your speed, jump three-quarters as far as normal, and lift three-quarters as much weight, rather than half your normal values. You also reduce the nonlethal bludgeoning damage dealt by extreme gravity environments by half.</p>	Magic	3	320	L	null	null	null	AA2	73
Hivemask (Worn)	<p>As a move action when wearing a hivemask, you can learn the location of each other worn hivemask within 100 feet and can use your vision to see through any one of those masks. You can see through another mask for as long as you’d like, but you must take a move action each round to do so.

Instinctive Stabilizer	<p>Kish shamans imbued this handheld scanner with mystical power to help heal the dying. When you use an instinctive stabilizer, you can use the Medicine skill untrained to attempt the long-term stability task. If you are trained in Medicine, you automatically succeed at this check. In addition, when you use this device, the DC for the first aid task of the Medicine skill is only 10.</p>	Magic	3	1400	L	null	null	null	DS04	45
Lawfinder	<p>This archaic, ornate compass is a holy trinket sacred to AbadarCorp, and its needle is shaped like a thin golden key. A lawfinder’s needle always points toward the nearest settlement of at least 1,000 people; within such a settlement, the needle points to the primary center of government or civil administration for the settlement. This item can’t detect a settlement more than 100 miles away, except for settlements with the bureaucratic quality (Starfinder Core Rulebook 405), which a lawfinder can detect up to 1,000 miles away. If no such settlements are within range, the lawfinder’s needle spins slowly.<br/> As long as the lawfinder’s needle points to a settlement or civil center, it grants you a +2 insight bonus to Survival checks to avoid getting lost.</p>	Magic	3	1200	L	null	null	null	PWD	200
Moon Crystal	<p>A moon crystal is luminous, raising the light level by one step in a 10-foot radius. It also provides 4 days of environmental protections as if it were armor, and it can be activated and depleted in the same way. The crystal can also sense when you need its protection and activate itself even if you’re unable to take actions. As a standard action, a creature holding a moon crystal can determine the remaining duration of its environmental protections. As the duration nears its end, the light in the crystal dims, and the crystal goes dark when its magic is fully expended. The crystal then crumbles to dust.</p>	Magic	3	200	L	null	null	null	AA3	69
Obfuscated Journal	<p>An obfuscated journal is usually a book filled with about 250 pages of sturdy blank paper. Those who value secrecy and portability use such tomes in place of other methods of information storage that might be less secure.<br/> Before you can write in an obfuscated journal, you must speak a word or phrase to the book as a standard action. If you don’t, the pages won’t hold any writing. If someone reads the journal without speaking the word or phrase you set, the words in the journal are an indecipherable jumble. You can also command the journal to erase all or part of the writing at a rate of 2 pages per round.<br/> The journal also defends against some forms of magical tampering. Writing in the journal is magical and encoded, but a creature under the effects of true seeing can read it. Dispel magic can suppress the journal’s magic, causing the pages to appear blank and preventing it from being used in any way. An erase spell can erase the journal only after the proper command is spoken.</p>	Magic	3	1250	1	null	null	null	ARM	114
Pilot's Helmet (Worn)	<p>This floppy leather helmet is equipped with large goggles that enhance a pilot’s acuity. While you are wearing a pilot’s helmet, if an enemy vehicle ahead of yours successfully uses the trick pilot action, you can immediately attempt a Perception check with a +4 insight bonus opposed by the result of the opposing vehicle’s skill check to perform the trick pilot action. If you succeed, the penalty imposed by the opposing vehicle’s trick pilot action is reduced by 1.</p>	Magic	3	1200	L	null	null	null	DF02	40
Polymorphic Serum, Mk 1	<p>Those unfamiliar with polymorphic serum often believe the churning, neon-green liquid to be toxic or radioactive at first glance. When created, each polymorphic serum is assigned a specific polymorphed form, as described by a polymorph spell of the serum’s level. All decisions regarding this polymorph form, such as whether it is a generic or a specific form, are determined when the serum is created. Any creature imbibing a polymorphic serum changes into the serum’s associated form for 2 hours × the serum’s mark (2 hours for mk 1, 4 hours for mk 2, and so on). If you are unwillingly subjected to a polymorphic serum (such as through a weapon with the injection special property), you can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level). If you fail, you can still dismiss the effect as normal for the polymorph spell.</p>	Magic	3	250	null	null	null	null	COM	126
Queen’S Meal	<p>This sacred meal, typically consumed in celebration of or on religious holidays dedicated to Hylax, was popularized on Ilemchuuva. Temples there normally produce large quantities of this meal on feast days, often at a discounted price. A queen’s meal is not only a day’s worth of food and water, but it also makes coordination and collaboration more effective and discourages hostility for 24 hours. While benefiting from a queen’s meal, you take a –1 penalty to your attack rolls, but you gain a +1 divine bonus to your EAC, KAC, Perception checks, and Sense Motive checks. In addition, if you attempt to aid another creature that has also eaten a queen’s meal that day, you apply a +2 circumstance bonus to your check. If you succeed, the highest result between you and the creature you’re aiding can be used to determine the aided check’s outcome.<br/> These cooperative effects have led to a tradition among followers of Hylax who work as diplomats or negotiators. They consume a queen’s meal at the start of talks to encourage peace. This practice was an element of the famous shirren-led peace negotiations between Castrovel’s formians and lashuntas.</p>	Magic	3	215	L	null	null	null	A!03	43

In addition, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against radiation for 1 hour.</p>	Magic	3	225	null	null	null	null	COM	126
Recovery Aegis (Worn)	<p>The Aspis Consortium partners with the Starfinder Society to deliver recovered relics to the churches of Desna, Iomedae, Sarenrae, Weydan, and Yaraesa. In exchange, mystics of these divinities provide magic items to support field agents. The recovery aegis is a talisman commonly produced as part of this arrangement. These necklaces take many shapes, but each has a jeweled pendant. The amulet counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> While wearing a recovery aegis, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to saving throws against effects you are already suffering, such as a disease, poison, or an ongoing damage effect; this bonus doesn’t apply to initial saving throws against such effects. In addition, at any point when you have the dying condition, you can use the recovery aegis to stabilize without spending Resolve Points, and you can then spend 1 Resolve Point to stay in the fight during the same round. The jewel in the recovery aegis crumbles to dust if you use it to stabilize in this way, and the amulet loses its powers, becoming nonmagical. If you use a recovery aegis to stabilize, you can’t do so with another recovery aegis for 24 hours.</p>	Magic	3	1350	L	null	null	null	ARM	115
Rings Of Fangs (Worn)	<p>When you wear this ring, your teeth become long and sharp, giving you a powerful bite attack. This grants you a special unarmed strike that deals lethal piercing damage and threatens squares within your reach. You must be able to use your mouth to bite to use this unarmed strike, but it does not require a hand to wield. If you are 3rd level or higher, you gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat that adds double your level to the damage of this unarmed strike (rather than adding your level).<br/><br/> <em><a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42ren?Ring-of-Fangs-Clarifications">Errata'd September 9th, 2019</a></em> <br/> <del>When you wear this ring, your teeth become long and sharp, giving you a powerful bite attack.

Serum Of Sex Shift	<p>Mass production has rendered this once-rare serum easy and inexpensive to obtain among the Pact Worlds. Upon drinking this elixir, your biology instantly transforms to take on a set of sexual characteristics of your choice, changing both your appearance and physiology accordingly. You have some mild control over the details of this change, but you retain a strong “family resemblance” to your former appearance.<br/> The elixir’s magic functions instantaneously and cannot be dispelled. Your new anatomy is as healthy and functional as your previous body’s, potentially allowing you to conceive, carry, or bear children (depending on your species’ biology). Drinking a second elixir of sex shift either reverts you back to a former form or allows you to adopt other sexual characteristics, as you choose. The elixir has no effect if you are unwilling, and the presence of certain sex-specific biological processes, such as gestation, may prevent this serum from taking effect.</p>	Magic	3	350	L	null	null	null	CRB	225

Spell Ampoules, 1St	<p>Spell ampoules are injectable magic, where the essence of a magic spell has been condensed into a liquid form and prepared for injection into a creature. Known colloquially as “spell amps,” these heady, ready-to-use magic injections can be used only once. A spell amp duplicates the effect of a beneficial spell (a spell with “harmless” in its Saving Throw or Spell Resistance entry), excluding divination spells or spells that create some link between the caster and the target. In addition, the spell must be 3rd level or lower, have a casting time of 1 minute or less, and target one or more creatures (but not spells that target just the spellcaster). If a spell targets both creatures and objects, it only affects creatures when used as a spell amp. If a spell requires expending a Resolve Point to cast, it also requires the user to spend a Resolve Point when used as a spell amp (if you choose not to spend a Resolve Point or don’t have any Resolve Points remaining, the spell amp has no effect). A spell amp always has an item level equal to three times the level of the spell it duplicates (treat as a 2nd-level item for spell amps with 0-level spells), and a caster level equal to its item level. Creating a spell ampoule has the same requirements as creating a spell gem (see below). You can only use a spell ampoule on yourself or a willing or unconscious creature. Injecting yourself or a willing creature with a spell ampoule is a standard action, while injecting an unconscious creature is a full action. Spell amps take effect as if the spell had been cast upon the creature injected. When you are injected with a spell amp, you get to make any decisions about the spell’s effect as if you were the caster of the spell— you are both the effective target and the caster of the effect.</p>	Magic	3	300	L	null	null	null	CRB	224
Adaptive Serum, Mk 1	<p>A dose of adaptive serum consists of a small piece of ksarik flesh (usually the tip of one of its tentacles) floating in a slightly alcoholic tincture. For an hour after you consume an adaptive serum, the first time you take energy damage, you gain resistance against that type of damage for that attack and for the remainder of the hour or until you rest 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, whichever comes first. The amount of energy resistance you receive depends on the level of the serum. A mk 1 adaptive serum grants energy resistance 5, a mk 2 adaptive serum grants energy resistance 10, and a mk 3 adaptive serum grants energy resistance 15.</p>	Magic	4	350	null	null	null	null	AA1	71

When you do so, until the end of your next turn, you reduce any cold damage dealt to you by half, and if an effect allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

Iomedaean Crusader Helm (Worn)	<p>Originally created before the Gap for holy champions of Iomedae crusading in the Worldwound—a demon-haunted wasteland created by an Abyssal incursion on Golarion— Iomedaean crusader helms have been in constant production by the church of Iomedae for thousands of years. While only ancient pre-Gap helmets are considered relics, the magical properties of modern Iomedaean crusader helms match their archaic precursors. An Iomedaean crusader helm replaces a suit of armor’s normal helmet (if any) and is incorporated into the armor’s normal environmental protections; these protections do not function if the helm is removed. If the armor has an available upgrade slot, an Iomedaean crusader helm takes up one upgrade slot; otherwise, the helm counts as one of your two worn magic items.<br/> While wearing an Iomedaean crusader helm, the first time each day that you attempt a saving throw against an enchantment or illusion effect created by an evil outsider, roll the saving throw twice and take the best result.

Planar Runeplates, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>Cultists and religious artificers forge planar runeplates, as do the demon-worshipping drow of Apostae. Each set of planar runeplates is dedicated to a specific powerful being native to the Outer Planes, such as an archdevil, a demon lord, or a god. Devotional symbols on the plates might convince others you’re aligned with the being in question, even if you’re not. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor; they count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark.<br/> Each set of planar runeplates has the same alignment as the extraplanar entity to which the plates are dedicated, although no plates are created with a neutral alignment with no other alignment components. While you wear the plates, they have several effects. If a creature with an alignment component opposite any of the plates’ alignment components attacks you, the plates alert you to the creature’s opposing subtypes. If the attack hits, as a reaction you can force the creature to reroll the attack and use the worse result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect created by such a creature, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the better result.

Despite the seeds’ function, they’re not technological, so they don’t usually show up on scanners looking for weapons or dangerous devices.<br/> As a move action, you can squeeze the seed to activate it and hold it or drop it in a square within your reach. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can squeeze and throw the seed (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a square (AC 5). At the end of the turn in which you activate the seed, it erupts into thick vines in the square it’s in, as well as all squares within 10 feet of the first. This area becomes difficult terrain.<br/> A creature caught in the vines must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or become entangled. An entangled creature can escape as a move action with a successful Acrobatics check or Strength check at the same DC.<br/> The vines last and renew themselves for 5 rounds; if the seed lands on a surface made of a material in which plants can’t normally grow, the vines last for only 2 rounds. When the duration ends, the seed and vines wither and turn to dust.</p>	Magic	4	675	L	null	null	null	ARM	117
Trampling Boots (Worn)	<p>These rugged boots are made from the finest mountain eel hide. You can ignore difficult terrain, but only in hilly and mountainous environments. In addition, once per day as a full action, you can move up to your speed through other creatures’ spaces (as long as those creatures aren’t larger than you are). Each creature in your path automatically takes 2d6+4 bludgeoning damage. A target of this trample ability can make an attack of opportunity against you as you pass through its space, but at a −4 penalty. A target can forgo this attack of opportunity to instead attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to take half damage.</p>	Magic	4	2500	L	null	null	null	AA1	79
Truth Amplifier	<p>This parabolic microphone is shaped like a pistol with a plastic cone for a barrel, and Kish shamans have imbued it with mystical power. To use a truth amplifier, point it at a sentient creature within 30 feet and pull the trigger (as a standard action). The target must then succeed a DC 14 Will save, or it can’t deliberately lie for 5 minutes. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment and can avoid answering questions they would normally respond to with a lie, being evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. A truth amplifier can be used once per day.</p>	Magic	4	2000	L	null	null	null	DS04	45
Aeon Stones, Sapphire Cone	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	5	3200	null	null	null	null	ARM	110
Arquand Manacles	<p>Interwoven hide from numerous Arquand gazelles lines Arquand manacles. Law officers and bounty hunters use these manacles on prisoners who might become aggressive. The interwoven strips help ensure the bound creature never becomes immune to the effect. While wearing Arquand manacles, you must succeed at a DC 13 Will save to attack, cast a spell, or attempt to disable, escape, or harm the cuffs. Arquand gazelles are immune to these manacles. Their magic is a mind-affecting, emotion effect.</p>	Magic	5	2800	L	null	null	null	AA2	13
Barachius Helm (Worn)	<p>This helm replaces a suit of armor’s normal helmet (if any) and is incorporated into the armor’s normal environmental protections; these protections do not function if the helm is removed. If the armor has an available upgrade slot, a barachius helm takes up one upgrade slot; otherwise, the helm counts as one of your two worn magic items.<br/> While wearing a barachius helm, once per day as a standard action, you can activate its ability to detect evil in your environment. Any creature you can see within 60 feet that has the evil subtype (such as a devil or an evil dragon) appears to have an obvious glowing outline visible only to you. Evil magic weapons (such as a rifle with the unholy weapon fusion) and other forms of evil technology gain a similar glowing outline. This doesn’t not increase your visual range or allow you to see invisible creatures.<br/> In addition, once per day, the wearer of a barachius helm can use the barachius’s firewall supernatural ability (see page 12).</p>	Magic	5	3000	L	null	null	null	AA1	13
Bloodbrother Serum	<p>Bloodbrother serum is made from rare alchemical reagents and the vital fluids of the eponymous beast. When the serum is consumed, you gain cold resistance 5 and regain 2 Hit Points per round for 5 rounds.</p>	Magic	5	500	null	null	null	null	AA1	23
Celestial Stole (Worn)	<p>This long, thin scarf is usually marked with an alternating pattern of light and dark shapes. While wearing a celestial stole, you gain cold resistance 5 or fire resistance 5 (your choice when you first don the stole); you can alter the type of energy resistance (choosing between cold and fire) once per day after 8 hours of rest. If you have cold or fire resistance from the solarian’s solar armor solar manifestation, increase that resistance by 5.</p>	Magic	5	3000	null	null	null	null	DS04	45
Dawnflower Melange	<p>This warm tea infused with magical spices functions like a serum (Starfinder Core Rulebook 225) and fortifies the mind and spirit when imbibed. Cafes near the Radiant Cathedral are often filled daily with Sarenite clerics enjoying this beverage while talking about the confluence of science and religion. Drinking this brew grants you a +2 insight bonus to Diplomacy, Mysticism, and Physical Science checks for 1 hour, and during that time you can attempt checks to recall knowledge with Mysticism and Physical Science untrained.</p>	Magic	5	475	null	null	null	null	DF01	53
Dented Kasa (Worn)	<p>A conical helm of battered metal, a dented kasa is a headgear with a history. Helmets of this sort belonged to veteran warriors of ages past, each dent representing a potentially mortal blow the kasa deflected. You wear the kasa by incorporating it into part of your armor’s headwear. The helmet counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> While wearing the dented kasa, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against critical hit effects. In addition, when you take a critical hit, you can spend 2 Resolve Points as a reaction to negate the resulting extra damage and critical hit effect. When you do so, the kasa gains a new dent, scratch, or other mark.</p>	Magic	5	3000	1	null	null	null	ARM	112
Diffraction Cloak, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>A diffraction cloak bends light around it, causing the garment to subtly shimmer and hinting at its ability to warp nearby energy. While you wear this cloak, it protects you from cold, electricity, fire, and force damage. If an attack dealing such damage targets your EAC and hits, as a reaction you can force the attacker to be reroll the d20 and use the lower result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect that deals such damage, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and use the higher result. If you use a given diffraction cloak, you can’t benefit from a different one for 24 hours.<br/> The cloak allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type.</p>	Magic	5	3200	1	null	null	null	ARM	112
Empty Orbit Emblem	<p>An Empty Orbit emblem serves as a badge of office for solarians of the Order of the Empty Orbit, or those honored by that organization. The emblem itself is a metal token depicting the orbit of planets in the Pact Worlds System, including a noticeable gap between Castrovel and Akiton. The emblem counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, which takes up one upgrade slot. When you wear this emblem in an easily visible location, including as an armor upgrade, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks against those who uphold the philosophy of the Cycle or who hold the Cosmonastery of the Empty Orbit in high esteem. Additionally, up to twice per day, when you rest for 10 minutes and spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points, you can meditate on this emblem to also regain 2d8+5 Hit Points. Members of the Order of the Empty Orbit and their allies take these emblems seriously, and wearing one falsely is likely to have negative social consequences.</p>	Magic	5	2600	null	null	null	null	A!04	52
Falcon Boots (Worn)	<p>Falcon boots were originally armored steel boots with integrated knee protection etched with falcons across the front. They were most commonly employed by a group called the Steel Falcons, a branch of the Eagle Knights of the Golarion nation of Andoran, and they were apparently designed for use specifically on sailing ships.<br/> As a move action while wearing falcon boots, you can set your own personal, local gravity to be perpendicular to any adjacent surface able to support your weight under normal gravity conditions. This personal gravity effect only functions in normal gravity or lower. While this personal gravity is active, you gain a climb speed equal to your land speed, and if knocked prone, you fall in accordance with your personal gravity (thus falling prone in your space, even if that is on a wall or ceiling, rather than falling toward the ground as defined by the environment’s normal gravity conditions). If you drop an item while your falcon boots are active, it also falls in your space. If you move from that square before picking up a dropped item, the item becomes subject to normal gravity.<br/> If you are not adjacent to a surface able to support your weight, your falcon boots cease to function and you are subject to normal gravity. You can also deactivate falcon boots as a move action. There is no limit to how long falcon boots can function as long as you remain on a surface able to support your weight.</p>	Magic	5	3000	1	null	null	null	DS01	51
Fiery Runeplates, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>Those who serve the light sometimes wear fiery runeplates, as do those who love fire or associate with entities of elemental flame or hellfire. These rectangular copper plates are about a foot long and half as wide, and they come in a pair. They might bear fiery iconography such as that of Sarenrae, Hellknights, a mighty elemental being, or the demon lord Flauros, or they might have only their runes for decoration. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor. The plates count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark number.<br/> While wearing fiery runeplates, as a standard action, you can command them to generate an aura of spiraling flames in all squares adjacent to your space. When a creature starts its turn in or enters the area on its turn, it takes fire damage according to the plates’ type, as shown on Table 1–26: Fiery Runeplates. A creature takes this damage only once per round and can attempt a Reflex save (see the table) to take half damage. The flames can damage flammable objects in the area.<br/> Once the runeplates are activated, the flames persist for up to a total of 10 rounds per day. They cease immediately if you are unable to take actions, and as a move action you can end the effect entirely or suppress the flames for 1 round. Rounds in which the flames are suppressed don’t count against their daily limit. If you use a given set of fiery runeplates, you can use a different set only after 24 hours have passed. <table> <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>ITEM LEVEL</th><th>DAMAGE</th><th>SAVE DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>5</td><td>5 F</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>9</td><td>10 F</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>13</td><td>15 F</td><td>17</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	5	3500	3	null	null	null	ARM	113
Figurine Of Wondrous Power, Obsidian Electrovore	<p>Each figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a creature no more than a few inches tall and long. As a standard action, you can speak the figurine’s command word to transform the figurine into a creature in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The figurine can’t change into a creature if it doesn’t have enough space to do so or if the environment can’t support the creature’s life functions. When the creature appears, it can act immediately on your turn. It understands and obeys your commands, and it understands Common but can’t speak. The creature considers your allies to be its allies and follows their orders when you aren’t able to give any.<br/> Each figurine in this entry can become a creature for up to 1 minute per day, though this duration does not need to be used continuously. After the figure has been in creature form for 1 minute, it reverts to figurine form and can’t be activated again for 24 hours. As a move action, you can dismiss the creature and return it to figurine form. The creature reverts to a figurine if killed. Although it can be healed while in creature form, the creature otherwise regains all its Hit Points 24 hours after its most recent activation. Therefore, if the creature is killed and reverts to figurine form, it can’t transform again for 24 hours.<br/> If you are within 30 feet of the creature when it returns to figurine form, the figurine appears in one of your empty hands or in your space (your choice). Otherwise, it reverts to figurine form as close to you as possible in its own space.<br/> A figurine of wondrous power becomes nonmagical if broken, losing its power to transform into a creature.</p>	Magic	5	3000	L	null	null	null	ARM	113
Monocle Of Recognition	<p>An unassuming brass eyepiece that can be fitted for any species’ visual sensors, a monocle of recognition helps you better tell friend from foe.

A radiant ensemble seems to simultaneously shine (increasing the light level by one step in a 10-foot radius) and cause light to bend around it (granting a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells and effects that cause the blinded or dazzled condition). Three times per day, you can cause the radiant ensemble to give off a brilliant flash of light as a standard action. When you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you is blinded for 1d4 rounds, unless they succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier), in which case they are merely dazzled for 1 round.</p>	Magic	5	3200	1	null	null	null	DF02	42

Serum Of Hibernation, Potent	<p>Scientists studying the hibernation-adapted flora native to Gluun isolated enzymes and compounds that aided in the species’ long sleep.

Most who use this serum do so to make long-distance spaceflight more tolerable or efficient, especially when moving large groups with limited space and resources.<br/> Upon drinking a serum of hibernation, you can allow yourself to fall into a deathlike trance for a time that depends on the potency of the serum. While in this hibernation, you need not eat, drink, or breathe. You awaken if you take damage or if anyone uses a medkit or more advanced medical technology to rouse you and succeeds at a DC 15 Medicine check. If roused before the duration ends, unless the Medicine check to rouse you succeeds by 10 or more, you suffer 1 temporary negative level and are exhausted.

Skyfire Saddle	<p>The Skyfire Legion rarely uses draconic steeds these days, but the tradition of forging magic items such as the Skyfire saddle is alive and well on Triaxus. This throwback to the Skyfire Legion’s glory days sees plenty of practical use throughout the galaxy. Other institutions such as the Aspis Consortium and Starfinder Society purchase these saddles for operations on worlds where mounts are plentiful.<br/> A Skyfire saddle provides a few benefits. When riding a creature fitted with one, reduce the DC by 5 of Survival checks attempted as part of actions to ride a creature. If the DC would be reduced to 0, you don’t need to attempt the check. In addition, when you fall from the saddle, it slows your fall, reducing the die size for falling damage by one (so 1d6 becomes 1d4). Further, anytime your mount needs to attempt a saving throw, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to either use your saving throw bonus in place of the mount’s or grant the creature a +2 insight bonus to its saving throw.</p>	Magic	5	2650	1	null	null	null	ARM	116
Spell Gem, 2Nd	<p>Consisting of one or more lattices of carefully arranged lines of rare metal and bits of precious stone in a silicon casing, each lattice in a spell gem is encoded with magical writings equivalent to the casting of a single, specific spell. Holding a spell gem in your hand unlocks little-used portions of your mind, granting you the ability to temporarily cast the spell encoded within the gem without using up your daily spell slots. You must hold the spell gem in your hand throughout the spell’s casting time and must spend at least a standard action using the spell gem, even if the spell’s casting time is shorter. Each spell stored within a spell gem can be cast only once, after which the magic encoded within the spell gem’s lattice is forever expended.<br/> Only spellcasters are capable of using spell gems—if you aren’t a spellcaster, you’re unable to make use of the knowledge that the gem unlocks. You don’t need to know the spell within a spell gem to use it, but the spell must be on your class’s spell list (or have otherwise been added to your spell list) and you must have a high enough key ability score to cast it. If the spell gem’s item level is higher than your caster level, once you’ve spent the full casting time of the spell, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the spell gem’s item level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell remains within the gem and you can attempt to use it again.<br/> To craft a spell gem, you have to know the spell you’re encoding into the gem. If a spell requires expensive materials as part of its casting (such as raise dead), you must provide those while crafting the gem, and the gem’s price is increased by the price of the components. You can create larger, compound spell gems with multiple spells in multiple lattices, with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it. Such spell gems can be used to cast only one spell at a time.</p>	Magic	5	450	L	null	null	null	CRB	224
Staff Of Mystic Healing	<p>Available in a variety of shapes and sizes, a staff of mystic healing usually takes the form of an archaic shepherd’s crook, carved with pre-Gap runes of origin denoting prosperity and long life. If you have the healing touch class feature, you can use that ability one additional time per day while holding the staff. You cannot use more than one staff of mystic healing each day to gain more than one additional use of healing touch, and a staff of mystic healing works only once per day.</p>	Magic	5	3700	1	null	null	null	CRB	224
Storage Goo	<p>When not in use, storage goo is a ball of slightly luminous putty, 6 inches in diameter, with the consistency of soft chewing gum. Skittermander mystics concocted this goo long ago as a novelty. The stuff’s usefulness, especially for smuggling, has seen its manufacture spread throughout the Veskarium and across known space.<br/> As a standard action, you can squeeze the goo to activate it. If the goo isn’t storing any items, this causes it to glow with blue light and remain active for up to 1 minute. While the goo is active, you can store up to 1 bulk of objects within it without changing the goo’s shape or size, as the objects appear to be deconstructed into blue light. You can store analog one-handed melee weapons, tools, and other simple objects, provided the objects are no more complex than analog melee weapons and require no power.<br/> If you activate goo that has stored objects inside, those objects reemerge, almost as if they’re being reconstructed in a display of blue light. If you’re holding the goo when the objects reemerge, you can have as many reappear in your hands as you have hands free, and the rest fall to the ground in your space. Once the goo releases stored objects, it turns to dust.</p>	Magic	5	500	L	null	null	null	ARM	116
Travel Treads, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>The wandering deity Weydan breaks pieces of himself off into mortal avatars to explore and experience the Material Plane. The first travel treads were gifts from such avatars bequeathed to fellow travelers. Followers of Weydan learned to create travel treads, and other organizations have copied the magic. Travel treads come in pairs, most often already attached to shoes, boots, or similar gear. You wear the treads by affixing them to existing footwear. The treads count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> While you wear travel treads, you reduce the amount of nonlethal damage you take from hustling and gain an enhancement bonus to Constitution checks when making a forced march. In addition, if you fail a saving throw against an effect that would render you dazed, entangled, paralyzed, prone, staggered, or stunned, or an effect that would reduce your movement speed, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the higher result. Alternatively, if an opponent succeeds at a combat maneuver to bull rush, grapple, reposition, or trip you, as a reaction you can force that attacker to reroll the  attack, taking the lower result. Once you benefit from a given set of travel treads, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.<br/> The exact benefits of travel treads are based on their model, including the number of rerolls they provide per day, as follows.</p>	Magic	5	2750	L	null	null	null	ARM	117
Weatherwear	<p>Millennia ago, an enterprising guild of azer mystics discovered how to weave garments entirely out of planar essence from the Plane of Fire. This newfound fashion of flickering flames was dubbed infernowear. It wasn’t long before the same azers figured out how to make similar clothes interwoven with planar fabrics from each of the Elemental Planes, creating garments of shifting sands, roiling snowfalls, or writhing lightning (dubbed dustwear, blizzardwear, and boltwear, respectively). These crafting techniques were thought to be lost during the Gap until an environmental scientist and amateur tailor found examples of these garments at the Brass Bazaar in the Burning Archipelago. She was able to reproduce these garments and began selling them under the general name of weatherwear, though the items have an unfortunate side effect, as detailed below. Each type of weatherwear can be integrated into any style of nonmagical clothing (Starfinder Core Rulebook 230), granting the benefits of that clothing in addition to its own benefits, though weatherwear must be worn over armor and you can wear only one type of weatherwear at a time. While wearing a specific type of weatherwear, you gain resistance 5 to the energy damage type associated with the garment’s elemental fabric (acid for dustwear, cold for blizzardwear, electricity for boltwear, and fire for infernowear). In addition, once per day, you can reroll a failed saving throw that would result in you taking energy damage of the corresponding type. However, if you roll a 1 on that second saving throw, you lose the provided energy resistance and instead gain vulnerability to that energy type for 1 minute.</p>	Magic	5	2750	1	null	null	null	DF04	50
Aeon Stones, Ruby Sphere	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	6	3850	null	null	null	null	AT02	44

Elemental Gem, Mk 2	<p>Each elemental gem contains one elemental from a specific elemental plane. The gem’s color indicates the sort of elemental contained within—air gems are transparent, earth gems are brown, fire gems are orange, and water gems are blue. As a standard action, you can crush the gem, destroying it. The contained elemental then appears as if you had cast a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144) of a level and caster level according to the gem’s type.</p>	Magic	6	650	L	null	null	null	ARM	112
Energy-Relay Gloves (Worn)	<p>Warriors across the Pact Worlds commission these gloves to gain versatility in the type of damage they deal. A set of energy-relay gloves is permanently configured to one damage type selected from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> If you hit with a weapon attack while wearing energyrelay gloves and deal additional damage, you can convert that additional damage to the gloves’ type. The gloves can convert additional damage from a class feature, a feat, and the additional damage dealt on critical hit, but they can’t convert additional damage from equipment, changes to a weapon’s damage dice, or spells. Using the gloves doesn’t change whether the attack targets EAC or KAC.</p>	Magic	6	4250	L	null	null	null	ARM	112
Eohi Boots (Worn)	<p>The insides of these simple-looking gray boots are lined with eohi fur (see page 57). Once per day as a full action, you can move up to your speed and make a full attack with melee weapons only. The penalty on each attack is –6 instead of –4, and you take a –2 penalty to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.</p>	Magic	6	4200	L	null	null	null	DS04	45
Ferocity Blazon (Worn)	<p>A fierce reputation is a benefit, but only if your opponents know of it. Symbols on clothing have long been used to create associations between a given group’s reputation and its members. A ferocity blazon is a decorated medal or tabard whose magic enhances any impression you make so that you’re better at intimidation.<br/> A ferocity blazon must be worn prominently to function. While you do so, when you succeed at an Intimidate check to bully or demoralize a creature, you double the duration of the effect. If you are in the captain role on a starship, when you take the taunt action and succeed at the Bluff or Intimidate check, you double the duration that enemy crew members take a penalty to checks.</p>	Magic	6	4000	1	null	null	null	ARM	113
Glove Of Storing (Worn)	<p>This simple glove is surprisingly smooth to the touch. While holding an item no larger than 2 bulk in the hand wearing it, you can command a glove of storing to shrink the held item to microscopic size and negligible bulk, and merge it with the palm of the glove. Returning the item to its original scale requires a mere snap of the fingers wearing the glove. You can store or retrieve an item within a glove of storing as a swift or move action. A glove of storing can store only one item at a time, and if the glove’s effect is suppressed or dispelled, any stored item immediately returns to its original size.</p>	Magic	6	4600	L	null	null	null	CRB	223
Hat Of Disguise (Worn)	<p>A hat of disguise can be a cap of any variety, a modified armor helmet, or an upgrade to armored headwear.

The hat counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.</p>	Magic	6	3850	L	null	null	null	ARM	114
Plasma Beads, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>These four spherical beads strung with a cord emit a slight fiery glow from the plasma magically sealed inside them. While you wear the necklace, as a standard action, you can detach a bead and throw it (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a grid intersection (AC 5). If you throw the bead through a narrow opening, your attack roll must equal or exceed the opening’s AC (10 for a narrow opening or 15 for an extremely narrow one) to avoid hitting the side and detonating the bead prematurely. When the bead strikes a hard surface, it explodes in a 20-foot radius, dealing electricity and fire damage according to its type, as shown on the table below. A target that succeeds at a Reflex save (see the table) takes only half damage. Once you detach a bead, it loses its magic if it hasn’t exploded after 5 rounds. If the necklace isn’t worn, detached beads immediately become nonmagical. <table> <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>ITEM LEVEL</th><th>DAMAGE</th><th>SAVE DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>6</td><td>3d6 E &amp; F</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>9</td><td>5d6 E &amp; F</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>12</td><td>9d6 E &amp; F</td><td>17</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	6	4200	L	null	null	null	ARM	115
Plasma Scabbard	<p>This thin metallic band can be affixed either to an existing scabbard that holds a melee weapon that deals kinetic damage or directly to the hilt of a melee weapon that deals kinetic damage. You can activate the device as a swift action when you draw the weapon, coating the weapon with a corona of plasma. The first successful attack you make with that weapon deals an additional 1d10 electricity and fire damage. Once you’ve used the plasma scabbard, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to charge it immediately.</p>	Magic	6	4250	L	null	null	null	DF01	53
Polymorphic Serum, Mk 2	<p>Those unfamiliar with polymorphic serum often believe the churning, neon-green liquid to be toxic or radioactive at first glance. When created, each polymorphic serum is assigned a specific polymorphed form, as described by a polymorph spell of the serum’s level. All decisions regarding this polymorph form, such as whether it is a generic or a specific form, are determined when the serum is created. Any creature imbibing a polymorphic serum changes into the serum’s associated form for 2 hours × the serum’s mark (2 hours for mk 1, 4 hours for mk 2, and so on). If you are unwillingly subjected to a polymorphic serum (such as through a weapon with the injection special property), you can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level). If you fail, you can still dismiss the effect as normal for the polymorph spell.</p>	Magic	6	675	null	null	null	null	COM	126
Regeneration Serum	<p>This vial is filled with a brownish liquid that appears to be as thick as tar. When using a regeneration serum, you choose one body part that was severed from your body or one organ that was ruined (such as by the wounding critical hit effect) and inject the serum via syringe to the corresponding region on your body. For 24 hours after injecting yourself with the serum, you require a day’s worth of food and fluids every hour (which you can ingest without any of the normal repercussions of such excessive consumption) or the serum’s effects stop without effect. During this time, your severed limb or ruined organ begins to regenerate. After 24 hours have passed, the limb or organ fully regenerates and is functional.<br/> Each regeneration serum can regenerate only one limb or organ at a time, and you cannot benefit from multiple regeneration serums simultaneously.</p>	Magic	6	600	null	null	null	null	COM	126
Ring Of Resistance, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>This ring grants you magic protection against attacks and effects to which you are particularly vulnerable. You gain an enhancement bonus to saving throws with your lowest base saving throw bonus. If two or three of your base saving throw bonuses are tied for lowest value, you select which category gains this bonus when you first put on the ring, and this choice does not change unless a different base saving throw bonus later becomes your lowest bonus. The bonus is determined by the model of the ring of resistance. <table> <tr><th>RING</th><th>BONUS</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 4</td><td>+4</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 5</td><td>+5</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	6	4200	null	null	null	null	CRB	223

Spell Ampoules, 2Nd	<p>Spell ampoules are injectable magic, where the essence of a magic spell has been condensed into a liquid form and prepared for injection into a creature. Known colloquially as “spell amps,” these heady, ready-to-use magic injections can be used only once. A spell amp duplicates the effect of a beneficial spell (a spell with “harmless” in its Saving Throw or Spell Resistance entry), excluding divination spells or spells that create some link between the caster and the target. In addition, the spell must be 3rd level or lower, have a casting time of 1 minute or less, and target one or more creatures (but not spells that target just the spellcaster). If a spell targets both creatures and objects, it only affects creatures when used as a spell amp. If a spell requires expending a Resolve Point to cast, it also requires the user to spend a Resolve Point when used as a spell amp (if you choose not to spend a Resolve Point or don’t have any Resolve Points remaining, the spell amp has no effect). A spell amp always has an item level equal to three times the level of the spell it duplicates (treat as a 2nd-level item for spell amps with 0-level spells), and a caster level equal to its item level. Creating a spell ampoule has the same requirements as creating a spell gem (see below). You can only use a spell ampoule on yourself or a willing or unconscious creature. Injecting yourself or a willing creature with a spell ampoule is a standard action, while injecting an unconscious creature is a full action. Spell amps take effect as if the spell had been cast upon the creature injected. When you are injected with a spell amp, you get to make any decisions about the spell’s effect as if you were the caster of the spell— you are both the effective target and the caster of the effect.</p>	Magic	6	700	L	null	null	null	CRB	224
Aeon Stones, Purple Sphere	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	7	7500	null	null	null	null	AA1	7
Conspirator’S Emblem (Worn)	<p>A conspirator’s emblem is a badge or amulet like those commonly worn to mark people as members of an organization. Insignia of the Aspis Consortium in particular are notorious for all sorts of secretive magic, including that of the conspirator’s emblem.<br/> As a standard action while wearing this emblem, you can create an aura of confidentiality in a 20-foot-radius spherical emanation centered on you. You can designate any number of willing creatures you can see within the aura as coconspirators. You and your coconspirators can converse normally so long as you remain within the aura, provided you share a language or another means of understanding one another. Other creatures inaccurately perceive your discussion, sensing a magically generated dialogue about a topic you designate. Comprehend languages reveals only that your conversation has a magical aspect, but a creature benefitting from a tongues spell or capable of truespeech understands your actual exchange if within the emblem’s aura.<br/> A conspirator’s emblem can create its emanation for up to 1 hour per day; this duration can be used in 10-minute increments. The effect ends immediately if you remove the item or fall unconscious. A creature participating in the emanation of any conspirator’s emblem for longer than 1 hour on a given day experiences psychic dissonance, becoming sickened while within the area and for 1 hour after each subsequent exposure.</p>	Magic	7	6500	L	null	null	null	ARM	111
Furtive Garment (Worn)	<p>The oldest furtive garments are robes and other clothing worn by followers of Lao Shu Po. Some of these relics originated on lost Golarion, or so priests of Grandmother Rat claim. Most of these vestments are cloaks, loose coats, mantles, scarves, or similar garments. Modern equivalents are sleeker, designed to integrate with existing outfits and armor. You can wear the garment over other clothing or light armor, in which case it counts as a worn item, or you can install it in light armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> As a standard action while wearing a furtive garment, you can command the item to change the shape and appearance of clothing or light armor you wear to that of other clothing or light armor you specify. This change is illusory, fooling all senses. In addition, your clothing or armor seems nonmagical to spells and abilities that detect magic. Despite appearances, whatever you’re wearing retains its normal properties while hidden by the illusion. As a standard action, you can end the effect, returning disguised clothing or armor to its normal appearance.</p>	Magic	7	5500	L	null	null	null	ARM	114
Luminous Brenneri Stone	<p>This small, smooth stone glows with a pale light that sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius around you. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes focusing on the brenneri stone to gain an additional effect; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. After you use the stone, the radius of its light effect is reduced to 5 feet for 24 hours. You can gain the benefits of only one brenneri stone per day. Brenneris can use their favored object racial trait with a brenneri stone and gain the benefits of both the item and the class feature.</p>	Magic	7	6000	null	null	null	null	AA3	9
Pathing Telescope	<p>Starfaring societies use advanced technology for viewing the stars and plotting courses among them. Triune’s clerics intertwined magic and technology to create the initial models of the pathing telescope to analyze the gulf between stars and perceive far-off worlds. Knowledge of how to build these telescopes is as freely distributed as knowledge of how to access the Drift.<br/> When you use the Piloting skill to astrogate, you can spend 1 hour studying the stars with a pathing telescope. If you do so and successfully plot a course, you reduce the travel time to reach a satellite by half or to travel within a system to 1d4+1 days. In addition, the telescope grants you a +3 insight bonus to skill checks to avoid becoming lost, whether you’re using Piloting to navigate on a planet or Survival to orienteer.</p>	Magic	7	7000	2	null	null	null	ARM	115
Restoring Rod	<p>Helixes and other geometric patterns swirl within the clear shaft of a restoring rod, which is capped with gold on each end. To use the rod, you must hold it. After you roll dice to determine the number of Hit Points or the amount of ability damage restored by a spell or effect you create, you can activate the rod if any of those dice have a result of 1 or 2. Doing so is part of the same action you took to cast the spell or create the effect. If you activate the rod, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to add 2 to each die with a result of 1 or 2.

For an hour after you consume an adaptive serum, the first time you take energy damage, you gain resistance against that type of damage for that attack and for the remainder of the hour or until you rest 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, whichever comes first. The amount of energy resistance you receive depends on the level of the serum.

While you wear Arquand horns, you receive a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against fear effects. In addition, as a standard action, you can command the Arquand horns to protect you with an aura that lasts for 1 minute. While the aura lasts, creatures within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier) to attack you, cast a spell that includes you as an unwilling target, or take any action to directly harm or disable your equipment. This is a mindaffecting, emotion effect, and a creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the aura for 24 hours. Arquand gazelles are immune to the aura. A set of Arquand horns can create this effect once per day, and after you have used one set of Arquand horns to create this effect, you can’t do so again with any other set for 24 hours.</p>	Magic	8	8400	L	null	null	null	AA2	13

Calcification Rod	<p>Kalos of the Brethedan moon of Kalo-Mahoi have developed numerous magical innovations honoring their artistic traditions. They created calcification rods, idealistically, to perfectly preserve objects of natural history that might otherwise rot away. Such rods see use well beyond Kalo-Mahoi, whether by scholars of natural history or those with less scrupulous aims. An authentic Kalo-Mahoian calcification rod is a rough shaft of coral that glows at the end that touches a chosen target.<br/> As a standard action, you can touch a calcification rod to a nonmagical object made of once-living matter, including a corpse. If the object fits into a 10-foot cube, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or turn to stone. If a creature holds or wears the target object, that creature can use its own Fortitude save bonus in place of the object’s.<br/> Alternatively, you can use the rod as a club (which counts as magic for the purpose of bypassing DR), or you can attempt to touch a creature with the rod by making an attack against its EAC. If your attack hits a creature that is living or made of onceliving matter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (at the same DC) or move one step further along the Dexterity poison track. While under this effect, a creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn each round, curing the affliction with one successful save. A creature that would reach the dead state is instead affected as if it had failed its saving throw against a flesh to stone spell, except it can attempt a new saving throw once every 24 hours to end the affliction.<br/> Any target that is immune to petrification is immune to this rod’s effects.</p>	Magic	8	9500	2	null	null	null	ARM	110
Divination Mirror	<p>You can use a divination mirror to display the results of divination spells that provide you with information or images, allowing others to see or otherwise experience this information as you do in real time. You must be within 30 feet of the mirror to use its capabilities. You can transmit to the mirror anything sensed by a magical sensor you create, such as with arcane eye or clairaudience/clairvoyance. The mirror can transmit sound, so you can cause it to reproduce what you hear from spells such as augury, commune with nature, contact other plane, detect thoughts, and divination. The mirror can display the aura of someone you subject to discern lies, as well as impressions and images you receive from spells such as retrocognition and vision. You can allow the mirror to transmit telepathic messages you receive so others present can hear that content. Divination spells that only change the nature of information you send and receive—such as comprehend languages, tongues, and true seeing—can’t be used through the mirror.</p>	Magic	8	8500	2	null	null	null	DF06	36
Eldritch Encephalon, Mk 1	<p>Eldritch encephalons were originally created in yah-thelgaad experiments when brain collectors sought to replicate the way they use the brains of deceased spellcasters, allowing other agents of the Dominion of the Black to also share brains among themselves. An eldritch encephalon is a lifeless, severed humanoid head inscribed with necromantic glyphs that run from just above each eye, over the scalp, and end at the base of the skull. A mass of slender, writhing tentacles extends from the neck or skull of the encephalon, often roiling and trembling as if attempting to grasp something that isn’t there. When placed on your shoulder, or on any patch of exposed skin that can support the weight of an average humanoid head, an eldritch encephalon burrows its tentacles into your flesh and merges with your physiology in a process that takes a full 24 hours to complete. Once attached, an encephalon counts as a worn magic item and can be sundered, but not disarmed. Once this process is completed, the command words to activate the encephalon are transmitted psychically to your brain, and the head seems to come to life as its runes begin to glow. The encephalon occasionally speaks of its own volition, espousing the thoughts and opinions of the spellcaster it was in life. You can never be bonded to more than one encephalon at a time, and removing one is a time-consuming process requiring a special necromantic ritual that takes several hours to perform. Any eldritch encephalon that has not been joined with a host creature for more than 12 days withers rapidly, disintegrating into dust. An eldritch encephalon allows you to cast a small selection of spells as spell-like abilities depending on the item’s model, using your character level as your caster level. The DC of any spell cast using an eldritch encephalon is equal to 10 + the level of the spell + your Charisma modifier.</p>	Magic	8	3500	L	null	null	null	DF04	48
Encryption Tattoo, Operative	<p>The secretive members of the Android Abolitionist Front identify each other with invisible magical tattoos. When you are within 60 feet of a being with another encryption tattoo and activate your encryption tattoo with a code word as a move action, your tattoo becomes visible for 1 minute and glows faintly. The tattoo closely resembles the glowing circuit patterns prevalent on android skin, and is therefore particularly obvious on non-androids. The agent encryption tattoo is the standard type of encryption tattoo. Certain encryption tattoos, when activated with a different code word, also grant you damage reduction: operative encryption tattoos provide DR 5/—, provocateur encryption tattoos provide DR 10/—, and master encryption tattoos provide DR 15/—. This damage reduction doesn’t stack with any damage reduction you already have. The damage reduction lasts for the 1 minute your tattoo is visible.<br/> Although there is no limit on the number of times you can cause your encryption tattoo to appear, you can activate its power to gain DR only once per day.<br/> An encryption tattoo doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered. In addition, it can be installed in an android’s racial armor upgrade slot.</p>	Magic	8	8900	null	null	null	null	PWD	200
Figurine Of Wondrous Power, Bone Crest-Eater	<p>Each figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a creature no more than a few inches tall and long. As a standard action, you can speak the figurine’s command word to transform the figurine into a creature in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The figurine can’t change into a creature if it doesn’t have enough space to do so or if the environment can’t support the creature’s life functions. When the creature appears, it can act immediately on your turn. It understands and obeys your commands, and it understands Common but can’t speak. The creature considers your allies to be its allies and follows their orders when you aren’t able to give any.<br/> Each figurine in this entry can become a creature for up to 1 minute per day, though this duration does not need to be used continuously. After the figure has been in creature form for 1 minute, it reverts to figurine form and can’t be activated again for 24 hours. As a move action, you can dismiss the creature and return it to figurine form. The creature reverts to a figurine if killed. Although it can be healed while in creature form, the creature otherwise regains all its Hit Points 24 hours after its most recent activation. Therefore, if the creature is killed and reverts to figurine form, it can’t transform again for 24 hours.<br/> If you are within 30 feet of the creature when it returns to figurine form, the figurine appears in one of your empty hands or in your space (your choice). Otherwise, it reverts to figurine form as close to you as possible in its own space.<br/> A figurine of wondrous power becomes nonmagical if broken, losing its power to transform into a creature.</p>	Magic	8	9000	L	null	null	null	ARM	113
Improvisation Adornment, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>Those who rely on speaking to persuade or please others and those who require the ability to gauge an audience find an improvisation adornment invaluable. This item is usually something worn on or near the head, such as a necklace, headband, or a mask. While wearing this item, if you fail a Bluff, Culture, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check, as a reaction you can reroll the check and take the better result. You can also reroll a Profession check, provided the GM agrees the check involved some sort of interaction, such as acting, musical performance, public speaking, and the like. Once you benefit from a given improvisation adornment, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.<br/> The adornment allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type.</p>	Magic	8	8400	L	null	null	null	ARM	114
Mask Of The Mantis (Worn)	<p>Once the traditional headgear for an ancient cabal of Golarion assassins called the Red Mantis, the mask of the mantis is now a relic sought by scholars of the missing planet, especially those seeking evidence that the Swarm visited Golarion at some time in the distant past. A mask of the mantis is a helmet that fully covers the head and face and has the appearance of a red insectile head with large compound eyes and long, backward-curving antennae. A mask of the mantis replaces a suit of armor’s normal helmet (if any) and is incorporated into the armor’s normal environmental protections; these protections do not function if the helm is removed. If the armor has an available upgrade slot, a mask of the mantis takes up one upgrade slot; otherwise, the mask counts as one of your two worn magic items.<br/> While wearing a mask of the mantis, you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. In addition, a mask of the mantis has 2 daily charges. As a standard action, you can expend 1 charge to gain either the effects of see invisibility (as per the spell) for 30 minutes or a +3 insight bonus to Perception checks for 30 minutes. Both of these effects can be active simultaneously, and each charge is replenished 24 hours after being used.</p>	Magic	8	8400	L	null	null	null	DS01	52
Planar Runeplates, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>Cultists and religious artificers forge planar runeplates, as do the demon-worshipping drow of Apostae. Each set of planar runeplates is dedicated to a specific powerful being native to the Outer Planes, such as an archdevil, a demon lord, or a god. Devotional symbols on the plates might convince others you’re aligned with the being in question, even if you’re not. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor; they count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark.<br/> Each set of planar runeplates has the same alignment as the extraplanar entity to which the plates are dedicated, although no plates are created with a neutral alignment with no other alignment components. While you wear the plates, they have several effects. If a creature with an alignment component opposite any of the plates’ alignment components attacks you, the plates alert you to the creature’s opposing subtypes. If the attack hits, as a reaction you can force the creature to reroll the attack and use the worse result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect created by such a creature, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the better result. Once you benefit from a given set of planar runeplates, you can benefit from a different set only after 24 hours have passed.<br/> Planar runeplates allow a number of rerolls per day based on their model.</p>	Magic	8	8500	L	null	null	null	ARM	115
Shattercoat (Worn)	<p>Mirrored shards of glass are sewn into the cloth of this long overcoat at regular intervals. Once per day as a standard action, you can cause the shards to jut outward at deadly angles for 1 minute. During that time, each time you are struck with a creature’s natural weapon or unarmed strike, that creature takes 2d6 slashing damage. The creature can attempt a Reflex saving throw or half damage. In addition, once per day, if you are struck with a critical hit from a creature’s natural weapon or unarmed strike, you can cause the shards to fly from the coat as a reaction, dealing 8d6 slashing damage to every creature in a 10-foot-radius burst (Reflex save half). The DC for either Reflex save is equal to 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier. After doing so, you can’t use the coat’s other protective ability for 24 hours.</p>	Magic	8	9000	L	null	null	null	DF02	42
Spell Gem, 3Rd	<p>Consisting of one or more lattices of carefully arranged lines of rare metal and bits of precious stone in a silicon casing, each lattice in a spell gem is encoded with magical writings equivalent to the casting of a single, specific spell. Holding a spell gem in your hand unlocks little-used portions of your mind, granting you the ability to temporarily cast the spell encoded within the gem without using up your daily spell slots. You must hold the spell gem in your hand throughout the spell’s casting time and must spend at least a standard action using the spell gem, even if the spell’s casting time is shorter. Each spell stored within a spell gem can be cast only once, after which the magic encoded within the spell gem’s lattice is forever expended.<br/> Only spellcasters are capable of using spell gems—if you aren’t a spellcaster, you’re unable to make use of the knowledge that the gem unlocks. You don’t need to know the spell within a spell gem to use it, but the spell must be on your class’s spell list (or have otherwise been added to your spell list) and you must have a high enough key ability score to cast it. If the spell gem’s item level is higher than your caster level, once you’ve spent the full casting time of the spell, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the spell gem’s item level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell remains within the gem and you can attempt to use it again.<br/> To craft a spell gem, you have to know the spell you’re encoding into the gem. If a spell requires expensive materials as part of its casting (such as raise dead), you must provide those while crafting the gem, and the gem’s price is increased by the price of the components. You can create larger, compound spell gems with multiple spells in multiple lattices, with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it. Such spell gems can be used to cast only one spell at a time.</p>	Magic	8	1400	L	null	null	null	CRB	224
Techbane Rod	<p>A simple wooden rod carved with sigils that pulse with magic, a techbane rod is particularly useful against those reliant on technology. These rods appeared during the Gap, likely created by spellcasters as an answer to rapidly expanding technology.<br/> As a standard action, you can touch a techbane rod to an unattended technological or hybrid item, weapon, or armor. If such an object fits inside a 10-foot cube, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds.<br/> If a creature is holding or wearing the object, you must succeed at a melee attack roll against the creature’s EAC to hit the target object. Alternatively, if a creature is wearing the object, you can use the techbane rod as a club (which counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming DR) to hit the wearer and the target object. If your attack hits, the object must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as normal, but the bearer can use its Fortitude save bonus in place of the object’s.<br/> You can instead touch the rod to a creature that has the technological subtype, targeting EAC, or you can use the rod as a magic club against such a creature. If your attack hits, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (at the same DC) or become staggered and unable to use energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A creature can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw at the end of its turn each round to end the effect early.</p>	Magic	8	10000	1	null	null	null	ARM	117
Teleportation Puck	<p>A teleportation puck is a dull black disc, about 6 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick, with a rough surface. If the puck is viewed with detect magic, runic patterns become visible on the puck’s surface. As a standard action, you can activate the puck and throw it (range increment 30 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a square (AC 5). If the puck is within 120 feet of you after you throw it, you can teleport to the puck’s location as a move action, carrying objects up to your maximum capacity. You can also bring up to two willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (or one willing or unconscious Large creature) with you, provided that all creatures that teleport in this way are touching at least one other creature that teleports at the same time.<br/> If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and all creatures traveling with you each take 1d6 force damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 10 feet of the puck’s location. If no such space exists within 10 feet, you and all creatures traveling with you each take 1d6 additional force damage and are shunted to an appropriate space within 30 feet. If no such space exists within 30 feet, you and all creatures traveling with you each take 2d6 additional force damage and the teleportation fails. Any creature that occupies the destination space and causes the teleportation to fail takes half the damage you do.<br/> Once thrown, the puck remains active either until you successfully teleport to it or until 5 rounds have passed. It then becomes a nonmagical object that can’t be used to teleport again.</p>	Magic	8	1500	L	null	null	null	ARM	117
White Knuckle Gloves (Worn)	<p>These bare-knuckle leather gloves are designed for those looking to pull off wild vehicle maneuvers.

If you do, you reduce the penalty to either check by 2 (minimum 0).</p>	Magic	8	8400	L	null	null	null	DF02	40
Aeon Stones, Vibrant Green Prism	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	9	14000	null	null	null	null	AT02	44
Anvil Of Torag	<p>Anvils of Torag are extremely rare and highly valued relics that are believed to have come from the Five Kings Mountains of lost Golarion. Each anvil consists of a heavy iron block anchored to a 5-foot-diameter stone base engraved with magical runes and symbols. Anvils of Torag are much prized by dwarf collectors and the crafting guilds of dwarven star citadels, as the anvils are seen as a tangible link to Torag, the patron god of the dwarves, who disappeared during the Gap. While non-dwarf collectors often consider an anvil of Torag too precious to use, most dwarves think it’s ridiculous to have a crafting relic and not actually use it.<br/> An anvil of Torag aids in crafting equipment and magic items. If you use an anvil of Torag while crafting an item, you are considered to have 2 additional ranks in the appropriate crafting skill, allowing you to craft items of higher level than you would normally be able to create. A given anvil of Torag can be used to craft only one item per day.<br/> Due its bulk and size, an anvil of Torag is generally not portable and must be properly anchored before use. An anvil of Torag can be installed on a starship in an arcane laboratory, a cargo hold, or a tech workshop, or it can be placed anywhere with room to store a Large vehicle.</p>	Magic	9	12000	50	null	null	null	DS01	50
Diffraction Cloak, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>A diffraction cloak bends light around it, causing the garment to subtly shimmer and hinting at its ability to warp nearby energy. While you wear this cloak, it protects you from cold, electricity, fire, and force damage. If an attack dealing such damage targets your EAC and hits, as a reaction you can force the attacker to be reroll the d20 and use the lower result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect that deals such damage, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and use the higher result. If you use a given diffraction cloak, you can’t benefit from a different one for 24 hours.<br/> The cloak allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type.</p>	Magic	9	12500	1	null	null	null	ARM	112
Dreamsilk Cloak (Worn)	<p>The original dreamsilk cloaks were woven from the purple silk of dozens of dream spiders, arachnids native to the vast Golarion jungle known as the Mwangi Expanse. Before the Gap, it was common for soothsayers and explorers to depend on the cloaks for the visions of the future that came to them in their sleep. Modern artificers have learned to make such cloaks by imbuing artificial fabrics with oils derived from transdimensional pesh.<br/> While wearing a dreamsilk cloak, you can see details in hallucinations and illusions that others overlook. This does not give you any bonus to saving throws against illusions, but if you successfully disbelieve an illusion and convey the fact that it is an illusion to others, they gain a +6 bonus to their saving throws to disbelieve, rather than the normal +4. Additionally, if you wear a dreamsilk cloak for an uninterrupted period of at least 16 hours and then sleep for at least 8 additional hours while still wearing it, you have a vivid, prophetic dream. Although the meaning of the dream isn’t immediately obvious when you wake up, you can learn more as the day progresses. Once during the next 24 hours, you can cast augury as a spell-like ability, using your character level as your caster level.</p>	Magic	9	13400	L	null	null	null	DS01	51
Elemental Gem, Mk 3	<p>Each elemental gem contains one elemental from a specific elemental plane. The gem’s color indicates the sort of elemental contained within—air gems are transparent, earth gems are brown, fire gems are orange, and water gems are blue. As a standard action, you can crush the gem, destroying it. The contained elemental then appears as if you had cast a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144) of a level and caster level according to the gem’s type.</p>	Magic	9	2000	L	null	null	null	ARM	112
Fiery Runeplates, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>Those who serve the light sometimes wear fiery runeplates, as do those who love fire or associate with entities of elemental flame or hellfire. These rectangular copper plates are about a foot long and half as wide, and they come in a pair. They might bear fiery iconography such as that of Sarenrae, Hellknights, a mighty elemental being, or the demon lord Flauros, or they might have only their runes for decoration. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor. The plates count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark number.<br/> While wearing fiery runeplates, as a standard action, you can command them to generate an aura of spiraling flames in all squares adjacent to your space. When a creature starts its turn in or enters the area on its turn, it takes fire damage according to the plates’ type, as shown on Table 1–26: Fiery Runeplates. A creature takes this damage only once per round and can attempt a Reflex save (see the table) to take half damage. The flames can damage flammable objects in the area.<br/> Once the runeplates are activated, the flames persist for up to a total of 10 rounds per day. They cease immediately if you are unable to take actions, and as a move action you can end the effect entirely or suppress the flames for 1 round. Rounds in which the flames are suppressed don’t count against their daily limit. If you use a given set of fiery runeplates, you can use a different set only after 24 hours have passed. <table> <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>ITEM LEVEL</th><th>DAMAGE</th><th>SAVE DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>5</td><td>5 F</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>9</td><td>10 F</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>13</td><td>15 F</td><td>17</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	9	14000	3	null	null	null	ARM	113
Plasma Beads, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>These four spherical beads strung with a cord emit a slight fiery glow from the plasma magically sealed inside them. While you wear the necklace, as a standard action, you can detach a bead and throw it (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a grid intersection (AC 5). If you throw the bead through a narrow opening, your attack roll must equal or exceed the opening’s AC (10 for a narrow opening or 15 for an extremely narrow one) to avoid hitting the side and detonating the bead prematurely. When the bead strikes a hard surface, it explodes in a 20-foot radius, dealing electricity and fire damage according to its type, as shown on the table below. A target that succeeds at a Reflex save (see the table) takes only half damage. Once you detach a bead, it loses its magic if it hasn’t exploded after 5 rounds. If the necklace isn’t worn, detached beads immediately become nonmagical. <table> <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>ITEM LEVEL</th><th>DAMAGE</th><th>SAVE DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>6</td><td>3d6 E &amp; F</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>9</td><td>5d6 E &amp; F</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>12</td><td>9d6 E &amp; F</td><td>17</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	9	12500	L	null	null	null	ARM	115
Polymorphic Serum, Mk 3	<p>Those unfamiliar with polymorphic serum often believe the churning, neon-green liquid to be toxic or radioactive at first glance. When created, each polymorphic serum is assigned a specific polymorphed form, as described by a polymorph spell of the serum’s level. All decisions regarding this polymorph form, such as whether it is a generic or a specific form, are determined when the serum is created. Any creature imbibing a polymorphic serum changes into the serum’s associated form for 2 hours × the serum’s mark (2 hours for mk 1, 4 hours for mk 2, and so on). If you are unwillingly subjected to a polymorphic serum (such as through a weapon with the injection special property), you can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level). If you fail, you can still dismiss the effect as normal for the polymorph spell.</p>	Magic	9	2100	null	null	null	null	COM	126
Ratfolk Belt (Worn)	<p>Ysoki are skilled at negotiating the cramped corridors of a starship or the access tunnels in a sprawling metropolis, but even the smallest ysoki sometimes encounter openings too small to enter. While wearing a ratfolk belt, you can move through an area as small as one-quarter your space without squeezing or one-eighth your space when squeezing. A ratfolk belt is made of stretchable nylon webbing, and it often includes clips for tools or weapons.</p>	Magic	9	12250	null	null	null	null	PWD	201
Rod Of Cancellation	<p>This device pulses with strange powers that drain items of all magical properties. When you touch a hybrid or magic item with a rod of cancellation, the item must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma bonus) or lose all magic abilities, becoming a mundane item of its type. If the touched item is being held or worn by a character, the item can use its bearer’s Will save bonus in place of its own, if better. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes nonmagical and cannot be used again. Drained items can be restored only with wish or miracle.</p>	Magic	9	2100	L	null	null	null	CRB	224

Stalkring, Obsidian	<p>The quorlus of Chuuva continue their species’ tradition of personal adornment. The most common of these is a stalkring, a band of stone or metal sized to be worn around a quorlu’s eyestalk.

Most stalkrings are decorative in nature, though the ever-pragmatic quorlus have also imbued some stalkrings with beneficial qualities.</p>	Magic	9	13000	null	null	null	null	A!03	43
Travel Treads, Mk 2 (Worn)	<p>The wandering deity Weydan breaks pieces of himself off into mortal avatars to explore and experience the Material Plane. The first travel treads were gifts from such avatars bequeathed to fellow travelers. Followers of Weydan learned to create travel treads, and other organizations have copied the magic. Travel treads come in pairs, most often already attached to shoes, boots, or similar gear. You wear the treads by affixing them to existing footwear. The treads count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> While you wear travel treads, you reduce the amount of nonlethal damage you take from hustling and gain an enhancement bonus to Constitution checks when making a forced march. In addition, if you fail a saving throw against an effect that would render you dazed, entangled, paralyzed, prone, staggered, or stunned, or an effect that would reduce your movement speed, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the higher result. Alternatively, if an opponent succeeds at a combat maneuver to bull rush, grapple, reposition, or trip you, as a reaction you can force that attacker to reroll the  attack, taking the lower result. Once you benefit from a given set of travel treads, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.<br/> The exact benefits of travel treads are based on their model, including the number of rerolls they provide per day, as follows.</p>	Magic	9	12000	L	null	null	null	ARM	117
Aeon Stones, Dark Blue Rhomboid	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	10	18000	null	null	null	null	CRB	222
Ring Of Resistance, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>This ring grants you magic protection against attacks and effects to which you are particularly vulnerable. You gain an enhancement bonus to saving throws with your lowest base saving throw bonus. If two or three of your base saving throw bonuses are tied for lowest value, you select which category gains this bonus when you first put on the ring, and this choice does not change unless a different base saving throw bonus later becomes your lowest bonus. The bonus is determined by the model of the ring of resistance. <table> <tr><th>RING</th><th>BONUS</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 4</td><td>+4</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 5</td><td>+5</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	10	18100	null	null	null	null	CRB	223

Spell Ampoules, 3Rd	<p>Spell ampoules are injectable magic, where the essence of a magic spell has been condensed into a liquid form and prepared for injection into a creature. Known colloquially as “spell amps,” these heady, ready-to-use magic injections can be used only once. A spell amp duplicates the effect of a beneficial spell (a spell with “harmless” in its Saving Throw or Spell Resistance entry), excluding divination spells or spells that create some link between the caster and the target. In addition, the spell must be 3rd level or lower, have a casting time of 1 minute or less, and target one or more creatures (but not spells that target just the spellcaster). If a spell targets both creatures and objects, it only affects creatures when used as a spell amp. If a spell requires expending a Resolve Point to cast, it also requires the user to spend a Resolve Point when used as a spell amp (if you choose not to spend a Resolve Point or don’t have any Resolve Points remaining, the spell amp has no effect). A spell amp always has an item level equal to three times the level of the spell it duplicates (treat as a 2nd-level item for spell amps with 0-level spells), and a caster level equal to its item level. Creating a spell ampoule has the same requirements as creating a spell gem (see below). You can only use a spell ampoule on yourself or a willing or unconscious creature. Injecting yourself or a willing creature with a spell ampoule is a standard action, while injecting an unconscious creature is a full action. Spell amps take effect as if the spell had been cast upon the creature injected. When you are injected with a spell amp, you get to make any decisions about the spell’s effect as if you were the caster of the spell— you are both the effective target and the caster of the effect.</p>	Magic	10	3000	L	null	null	null	CRB	224
Starship In A Bottle	<p>When purchased or crafted, a starship in a bottle looks like a miniature model of a generic starship within a plain, narrownecked glass bottle. However, when placed in a prominent location on a starship’s bridge for 24 hours, the model links to that starship and transforms into an exact replica of it. During starship combat, the replica can sometimes be seen to turn and twist in the same maneuvers the linked starship is performing. A member of the linked starship’s crew (meaning anyone holding one of the major starship combat roles) can hold the starship in a bottle in two hands and concentrate for 10 minutes to transfer all the Hull Point damage of the linked starship to the replica. The linked starship is returned to full Hull Points, while the various dents, scratches, and even holes in the linked starship’s hull visibly transfer to the replica. Up to 150 Hull Points of damage can be transferred to the replica before it loses all its magic, becoming a mundane trinket of a wrecked starship inside of a bottle. A starship can be linked to only one starship in a bottle at a time. A spellcaster can cast either mending or make whole on the starship in a bottle to repair the replica’s Hull Point damage once per day, but doing so creates a feedback loop between the spellcaster and the magic item. The spellcaster takes an amount of Hit Point damage equal to twice the number of Hull Points restored; this damage can’t be reduced in any way (though it can be healed as normal). There is no other way to repair the Hull Point damage done to the replica.</p>	Magic	10	17500	2	null	null	null	DF04	49
Temporal Crystal	<p>After rolling an initiative check, and before anyone else’s initiative results are revealed, you can use a temporal crystal to adjust your position in time. Choose a number between 1 and 25; this number becomes your initiative count for that combat. In the case of a tie, you go before any characters who rolled that initiative count. A temporal crystal can be used only once, which destroys the crystal.</p>	Magic	10	2900	null	null	null	null	AA3	117
Aballonian Drone Box	<p>This item consists of six 1-footsquare circuit boards soldered together at their edges to form a box. One of the sides is hinged, forming a lid. Although the box appears empty, it rattles occasionally, as if something inside is seeking to escape. While anacites across Aballon create these items, Those Who Wait prefer to stockpile them for future use, but Those Who Become send as many of these boxes into the galaxy as possible for unspoken reasons.<br/> When you speak a command word and open the lid of the box as a standard action, a collection of fist-sized microbots swarms out of the box and circles you, granting you concealment against all attacks for 5 rounds before they collapse into 1 bulk of inert scrap. This function can be used once per day.<br/> The scrap can be used as the target of any spell with the word “junkbot” in the name, and the duration of such a spell increases by 1 round. The refuse left over at the end of the spell magically returns to the box, as does the scrap if it remains unused 4 hours after being created.</p>	Magic	11	24500	1	null	null	null	PWD	200
Aeon Stones, Alabaster Helix	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	11	30000	null	null	null	null	ARM	110

Incense Of Open Thoughts	<p>When a block of this sweet-smelling incensed is lit (a standard action), creatures inhaling its fumes become unusually receptive to thought. In still air, the incense’s smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40-foot area to a height of 20 feet over the course of 1 minute. Creatures within that area can communicate telepathically with other creatures in the area. Creatures communicating in this fashion don’t need to share a language, but must have an intelligence modifier of –2 or greater. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also provides a +4 insight bonus to Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks against creatures in the area, and imposes a –4 penalty to Bluff and Intimidate checks against such creatures, and a –2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects.<br/> A moderate wind (11+ mph) halves the area of the smoke. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of open thoughts burns for 1 hour and is consumed in the process. It can be extinguished and relit, but each use consumes at least 10 minutes of its remaining duration.</p>	Magic	11	3500	null	null	null	null	A!04	44
Inspiration Blazon (Worn)	<p>Inspiration can play a large part in success, and as such some leaders wear magical symbols to inspire their allies during tough situations. An inspiration blazon is a decorated medal or tabard that lets you lend your allies your Resolve.<br/> An inspiration blazon must be worn prominently to function. When an ally within 60 feet of you spends Resolve Points, as a reaction while you are wearing an inspiration blazon, you can activate the blazon to inspire that ally, provided that you can see and be heard by the ally. You speak words of encouragement and spend up to 2 Resolve Points to reduce the number of Resolve Points your ally spends by the amount you spent, to a minimum of 0. The blazon has no effect on an ally who has no Resolve Points. An inspiration blazon can’t affect a given ally again until that ally regains Resolve Points during an 8-hour rest.</p>	Magic	11	23500	1	null	null	null	ARM	114
Radiant Brenneri Stone	<p>This small, smooth stone glows with a pale light that sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius around you. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes focusing on the brenneri stone to gain an additional effect; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. After you use the stone, the radius of its light effect is reduced to 5 feet for 24 hours. You can gain the benefits of only one brenneri stone per day. Brenneris can use their favored object racial trait with a brenneri stone and gain the benefits of both the item and the class feature.</p>	Magic	11	24000	null	null	null	null	AA3	9
Ring Of Cosmic Alignment (Worn)	<p>This majestic ring is forged from twin bands of mithral and adamantine. If you have the stellar mode class feature, whenever you start a turn of combat attuned to a stellar mode and choose to become unattuned, you can immediately gain 1 attunement point for the stellar mode that opposes the mode you began your turn in. For instance, if you began the turn in photon mode and choose to become unattuned, you can use the ring to gain 1 graviton attunement point. Using this ability is a swift action.</p>	Magic	11	25000	null	null	null	null	CRB	223
Ring Of Counterspells (Worn)	<p>Spell duels are traditional in cultures throughout not only the Pact Worlds but the entire galaxy. A wily duelist might wear a ring of counterspells to foil one of an opponent’s tricks, though these rings also work well against enemies who employ predictable offensive magic.<br/> A spellcaster can target a ring of counterspells with a spell. That spell has no effect other than being stored in the ring. While you wear the ring, if you would be a target of the spell stored in the ring, the spell fails and has no effect. This countering is automatic; it requires no action or awareness on your part. Once the ring counters a spell, the stored spell dissipates, and the ring can’t counter a spell until another is stored within it.</p>	Magic	11	24000	null	null	null	null	ARM	116
Sophic Philter	<p>Emitted from a willing philosopher worm’s magical cells, a sophic philter grants you a brief vision that attempts to answer whatever question is foremost in your mind when you drink it. This vision functions as if you cast a divination spell, but you spend no Resolve Point and have no chance of failure. In addition, tiny glowing runes matching the worm’s appear on or around your sensory organs, granting you a +4 insight bonus to Diplomacy checks against insectile creatures of any creature type for 1 week.</p>	Magic	11	4500	null	null	null	null	AA3	79
Spell Gem, 4Th	<p>Consisting of one or more lattices of carefully arranged lines of rare metal and bits of precious stone in a silicon casing, each lattice in a spell gem is encoded with magical writings equivalent to the casting of a single, specific spell. Holding a spell gem in your hand unlocks little-used portions of your mind, granting you the ability to temporarily cast the spell encoded within the gem without using up your daily spell slots. You must hold the spell gem in your hand throughout the spell’s casting time and must spend at least a standard action using the spell gem, even if the spell’s casting time is shorter. Each spell stored within a spell gem can be cast only once, after which the magic encoded within the spell gem’s lattice is forever expended.<br/> Only spellcasters are capable of using spell gems—if you aren’t a spellcaster, you’re unable to make use of the knowledge that the gem unlocks. You don’t need to know the spell within a spell gem to use it, but the spell must be on your class’s spell list (or have otherwise been added to your spell list) and you must have a high enough key ability score to cast it. If the spell gem’s item level is higher than your caster level, once you’ve spent the full casting time of the spell, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the spell gem’s item level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell remains within the gem and you can attempt to use it again.<br/> To craft a spell gem, you have to know the spell you’re encoding into the gem. If a spell requires expensive materials as part of its casting (such as raise dead), you must provide those while crafting the gem, and the gem’s price is increased by the price of the components. You can create larger, compound spell gems with multiple spells in multiple lattices, with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it. Such spell gems can be used to cast only one spell at a time.</p>	Magic	11	3700	L	null	null	null	CRB	224
Adaptive Serum, Mk 3	<p>A dose of adaptive serum consists of a small piece of ksarik flesh (usually the tip of one of its tentacles) floating in a slightly alcoholic tincture. For an hour after you consume an adaptive serum, the first time you take energy damage, you gain resistance against that type of damage for that attack and for the remainder of the hour or until you rest 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, whichever comes first. The amount of energy resistance you receive depends on the level of the serum. A mk 1 adaptive serum grants energy resistance 5, a mk 2 adaptive serum grants energy resistance 10, and a mk 3 adaptive serum grants energy resistance 15.</p>	Magic	12	5500	null	null	null	null	AA1	71
Aeon Stones, Iridescent Trillian	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you.

Improvisation Adornment, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>Those who rely on speaking to persuade or please others and those who require the ability to gauge an audience find an improvisation adornment invaluable. This item is usually something worn on or near the head, such as a necklace, headband, or a mask. While wearing this item, if you fail a Bluff, Culture, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check, as a reaction you can reroll the check and take the better result. You can also reroll a Profession check, provided the GM agrees the check involved some sort of interaction, such as acting, musical performance, public speaking, and the like. Once you benefit from a given improvisation adornment, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.<br/> The adornment allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type.</p>	Magic	12	33500	L	null	null	null	ARM	114
Mantle Of Willpower (Worn)	<p>A mantle of willpower is a garment that covers the shoulders, sometimes with a hood and sometimes including a longer cape. High-ranking members of the Knights of Golarion and the Stewards have been known to wear such mantles, as they help keep you calm and in control of your faculties.<br/> While wearing this mantle, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects. In addition, as a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to end all mind-affecting effects you are currently suffering from. If a mind-affecting effect renders you unable to take or determine your actions, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to end all mind-affecting effects you are currently suffering at the start of your turn, but you are then stunned until the start of your next turn. You can spend up to 2 Resolve Points per day to activate the mantle’s abilities. Once you spend any Resolve Points using a given mantle of willpower, that mantle won’t work for anyone else for 24 hours and you can’t use a different one for 24 hours.</p>	Magic	12	37000	1	null	null	null	ARM	114
Planar Runeplates, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>Cultists and religious artificers forge planar runeplates, as do the demon-worshipping drow of Apostae. Each set of planar runeplates is dedicated to a specific powerful being native to the Outer Planes, such as an archdevil, a demon lord, or a god. Devotional symbols on the plates might convince others you’re aligned with the being in question, even if you’re not. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor; they count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark.<br/> Each set of planar runeplates has the same alignment as the extraplanar entity to which the plates are dedicated, although no plates are created with a neutral alignment with no other alignment components. While you wear the plates, they have several effects. If a creature with an alignment component opposite any of the plates’ alignment components attacks you, the plates alert you to the creature’s opposing subtypes. If the attack hits, as a reaction you can force the creature to reroll the attack and use the worse result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect created by such a creature, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the better result. Once you benefit from a given set of planar runeplates, you can benefit from a different set only after 24 hours have passed.<br/> Planar runeplates allow a number of rerolls per day based on their model.</p>	Magic	12	34000	L	null	null	null	ARM	115
Plasma Beads, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>These four spherical beads strung with a cord emit a slight fiery glow from the plasma magically sealed inside them. While you wear the necklace, as a standard action, you can detach a bead and throw it (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a grid intersection (AC 5). If you throw the bead through a narrow opening, your attack roll must equal or exceed the opening’s AC (10 for a narrow opening or 15 for an extremely narrow one) to avoid hitting the side and detonating the bead prematurely. When the bead strikes a hard surface, it explodes in a 20-foot radius, dealing electricity and fire damage according to its type, as shown on the table below. A target that succeeds at a Reflex save (see the table) takes only half damage. Once you detach a bead, it loses its magic if it hasn’t exploded after 5 rounds. If the necklace isn’t worn, detached beads immediately become nonmagical. <table> <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>ITEM LEVEL</th><th>DAMAGE</th><th>SAVE DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>6</td><td>3d6 E &amp; F</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>9</td><td>5d6 E &amp; F</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>12</td><td>9d6 E &amp; F</td><td>17</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	12	37500	L	null	null	null	ARM	115
Polymorphic Serum, Mk 4	<p>Those unfamiliar with polymorphic serum often believe the churning, neon-green liquid to be toxic or radioactive at first glance. When created, each polymorphic serum is assigned a specific polymorphed form, as described by a polymorph spell of the serum’s level. All decisions regarding this polymorph form, such as whether it is a generic or a specific form, are determined when the serum is created. Any creature imbibing a polymorphic serum changes into the serum’s associated form for 2 hours × the serum’s mark (2 hours for mk 1, 4 hours for mk 2, and so on). If you are unwillingly subjected to a polymorphic serum (such as through a weapon with the injection special property), you can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level). If you fail, you can still dismiss the effect as normal for the polymorph spell.</p>	Magic	12	5700	null	null	null	null	COM	126

While you wear this cloak, it protects you from cold, electricity, fire, and force damage.

Eldritch Encephalon, Mk 2	<p>Eldritch encephalons were originally created in yah-thelgaad experiments when brain collectors sought to replicate the way they use the brains of deceased spellcasters, allowing other agents of the Dominion of the Black to also share brains among themselves. An eldritch encephalon is a lifeless, severed humanoid head inscribed with necromantic glyphs that run from just above each eye, over the scalp, and end at the base of the skull. A mass of slender, writhing tentacles extends from the neck or skull of the encephalon, often roiling and trembling as if attempting to grasp something that isn’t there. When placed on your shoulder, or on any patch of exposed skin that can support the weight of an average humanoid head, an eldritch encephalon burrows its tentacles into your flesh and merges with your physiology in a process that takes a full 24 hours to complete. Once attached, an encephalon counts as a worn magic item and can be sundered, but not disarmed. Once this process is completed, the command words to activate the encephalon are transmitted psychically to your brain, and the head seems to come to life as its runes begin to glow. The encephalon occasionally speaks of its own volition, espousing the thoughts and opinions of the spellcaster it was in life. You can never be bonded to more than one encephalon at a time, and removing one is a time-consuming process requiring a special necromantic ritual that takes several hours to perform. Any eldritch encephalon that has not been joined with a host creature for more than 12 days withers rapidly, disintegrating into dust. An eldritch encephalon allows you to cast a small selection of spells as spell-like abilities depending on the item’s model, using your character level as your caster level. The DC of any spell cast using an eldritch encephalon is equal to 10 + the level of the spell + your Charisma modifier.</p>	Magic	13	12500	L	null	null	null	DF04	48
Encryption Tattoo, Provocateur	<p>The secretive members of the Android Abolitionist Front identify each other with invisible magical tattoos. When you are within 60 feet of a being with another encryption tattoo and activate your encryption tattoo with a code word as a move action, your tattoo becomes visible for 1 minute and glows faintly. The tattoo closely resembles the glowing circuit patterns prevalent on android skin, and is therefore particularly obvious on non-androids. The agent encryption tattoo is the standard type of encryption tattoo. Certain encryption tattoos, when activated with a different code word, also grant you damage reduction: operative encryption tattoos provide DR 5/—, provocateur encryption tattoos provide DR 10/—, and master encryption tattoos provide DR 15/—. This damage reduction doesn’t stack with any damage reduction you already have. The damage reduction lasts for the 1 minute your tattoo is visible.<br/> Although there is no limit on the number of times you can cause your encryption tattoo to appear, you can activate its power to gain DR only once per day.<br/> An encryption tattoo doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered. In addition, it can be installed in an android’s racial armor upgrade slot.</p>	Magic	13	48000	null	null	null	null	PWD	200
Fiery Runeplates, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>Those who serve the light sometimes wear fiery runeplates, as do those who love fire or associate with entities of elemental flame or hellfire. These rectangular copper plates are about a foot long and half as wide, and they come in a pair. They might bear fiery iconography such as that of Sarenrae, Hellknights, a mighty elemental being, or the demon lord Flauros, or they might have only their runes for decoration. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor. The plates count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark number.<br/> While wearing fiery runeplates, as a standard action, you can command them to generate an aura of spiraling flames in all squares adjacent to your space. When a creature starts its turn in or enters the area on its turn, it takes fire damage according to the plates’ type, as shown on Table 1–26: Fiery Runeplates. A creature takes this damage only once per round and can attempt a Reflex save (see the table) to take half damage. The flames can damage flammable objects in the area.<br/> Once the runeplates are activated, the flames persist for up to a total of 10 rounds per day. They cease immediately if you are unable to take actions, and as a move action you can end the effect entirely or suppress the flames for 1 round. Rounds in which the flames are suppressed don’t count against their daily limit. If you use a given set of fiery runeplates, you can use a different set only after 24 hours have passed. <table> <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>ITEM LEVEL</th><th>DAMAGE</th><th>SAVE DC</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>5</td><td>5 F</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>9</td><td>10 F</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>13</td><td>15 F</td><td>17</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	13	56000	3	null	null	null	ARM	113
Figurine Of Wondrous Power, Bloodstone Bloodbrother	<p>Each figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a creature no more than a few inches tall and long. As a standard action, you can speak the figurine’s command word to transform the figurine into a creature in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The figurine can’t change into a creature if it doesn’t have enough space to do so or if the environment can’t support the creature’s life functions. When the creature appears, it can act immediately on your turn. It understands and obeys your commands, and it understands Common but can’t speak. The creature considers your allies to be its allies and follows their orders when you aren’t able to give any.<br/> Each figurine in this entry can become a creature for up to 1 minute per day, though this duration does not need to be used continuously. After the figure has been in creature form for 1 minute, it reverts to figurine form and can’t be activated again for 24 hours. As a move action, you can dismiss the creature and return it to figurine form. The creature reverts to a figurine if killed. Although it can be healed while in creature form, the creature otherwise regains all its Hit Points 24 hours after its most recent activation. Therefore, if the creature is killed and reverts to figurine form, it can’t transform again for 24 hours.<br/> If you are within 30 feet of the creature when it returns to figurine form, the figurine appears in one of your empty hands or in your space (your choice). Otherwise, it reverts to figurine form as close to you as possible in its own space.<br/> A figurine of wondrous power becomes nonmagical if broken, losing its power to transform into a creature.</p>	Magic	13	48000	L	null	null	null	ARM	113
Flux Fig	<p>A flux fig is a single-use consumable item that rearranges your genetic code and remakes you into another species.

A flux fig always transforms you into a species of your creature type that has racial traits for player characters, though exactly which species is determined randomly by the GM. Flux figs have no effect on constructs, outsiders, or undead.<br/> You recalculate your ability scores from scratch using your new racial traits (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). Upon awakening, you lose any former racial traits and gain new racial traits. You retain your personality, memories, augmentations, class features, feats, and skill ranks. You can’t change any choices made during prior character advancement, and you must still meet any prerequisites of equipment, feats, and other player options to be able to use those options. Those who take such a gamble and are unhappy with the results often invest in a mnemonic.</p>	Magic	13	8500	null	null	null	null	AA3	75
Phase Twin Generator	<p>A phase twin generator is a pistol-like device composed of ever-shifting components that appear as black crystalline prisms laced with light-blue lines. As a standard action, you can make a ranged attack with the phase twin generator (which counts as a small arm) against a living creature, targeting EAC, with a range increment of 30 feet. If the attack hits, the phase twin generator generates a ghostly, incorporeal version of the target, known as a phase twin, in a space adjacent to you (if there is no such space available, the phase twin generator does not generate the phase twin). The phase twin has all the statistics of the creature it was generated from, except it has the incorporeal special ability, it is mindless, it has no speeds except for a land speed of 5 feet, and it has Hit Points equal to one-quarter of the target’s maximum Hit Points. The phase twin acts on the initiative count of the creature it was generated from, and it cannot take any actions other than one move action to move its speed per turn, which it uses to move toward the creature it was generated from, if possible. Whenever the phase twin takes damage from an effect that does not also damage the target creature, the target creature also takes that amount of damage as force damage. A phase twin lasts either for 10 rounds or until the target creature dies, whichever comes first, after which it dissipates. A phase twin generator can generate a phase twin only once per day, and a creature can be affected by only one phase twin generator per day.</p>	Magic	13	52000	1	null	null	null	DF02	43
Ring Of The Ninth Truth (Worn)	<p>A rare velstrac item that neither causes nor relies on pain, a ring of the ninth truth is a prize to anyone seeking insight or personal enlightenment. The ring’s guidance is accurate, but it is often cryptic, utterly amoral, and rarely safe.<br/> A ring of the ninth truth functions as a mk 3 ring of resistance. It also gives you powers of prescience. Once per day, you can enter a trance for 1 minute and focus on your planned actions in the immediate future, gaining an intuitive insight into the results of your actions with regard to your personal values and goals. You learn whether your course might be beneficial to you, harmful to you, both, or neither. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge this power, but the ring can be used this way no more than three times per day.<br/> In addition, once per week, you can enter a similar trance for 10 minutes and spend 1 Resolve Point, seeking insight into a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within the next week. You receive an enigmatic and unsettling vision pertaining to your query. This vision always contains useful hints that can guide your steps toward the chosen event or goal.<br/> Any mortal using a ring of the ninth truth eventually attracts the notice of velstracs. The form this attention takes is often subtle, augmenting the ring’s ministrations with fiendish aid intended to usher the wearer down the path of darkness. Rumors speak of rings of this sort that allow a wearer to safely contact a mighty velstrac, as if using contact other plane, with the price of reciprocating that velstrac’s aid.</p>	Magic	13	51000	null	null	null	null	SS2	53
Shantak Whistle	<p>Resembling the skull of a shantak but carved from its wing bone, a shantak whistle is a recorder-like instrument with several decorative holes drilled in its length—though only one tone may be produced by blowing into this whistle, and only shantaks can hear the sound. All others hear nothing but the soft rush of breath sweeping through the instrument. When you play a shantak whistle for 1 minute, its song reaches out to the stars, and within 1d6 hours, a single shantak arrives at your location.<br/> Once it arrives, a shantak is under no magical compulsion to serve you, but you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to skill checks to secure the shantak’s service as a mount (at the GM’s discretion, usually requiring Diplomacy or Intimidate) for one Large or smaller creature. Even a shantak compelled to serve as a mount usually refuses to participate in battle and is likely to cooperate only long enough for a one-way trip using its spaceflight ability.<br/> A shantak whistle can be used only once every 2 weeks.</p>	Magic	13	49000	L	null	null	null	AA2	111
Travel Treads, Mk 3 (Worn)	<p>The wandering deity Weydan breaks pieces of himself off into mortal avatars to explore and experience the Material Plane. The first travel treads were gifts from such avatars bequeathed to fellow travelers. Followers of Weydan learned to create travel treads, and other organizations have copied the magic. Travel treads come in pairs, most often already attached to shoes, boots, or similar gear. You wear the treads by affixing them to existing footwear. The treads count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br/> While you wear travel treads, you reduce the amount of nonlethal damage you take from hustling and gain an enhancement bonus to Constitution checks when making a forced march. In addition, if you fail a saving throw against an effect that would render you dazed, entangled, paralyzed, prone, staggered, or stunned, or an effect that would reduce your movement speed, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the higher result. Alternatively, if an opponent succeeds at a combat maneuver to bull rush, grapple, reposition, or trip you, as a reaction you can force that attacker to reroll the  attack, taking the lower result. Once you benefit from a given set of travel treads, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.<br/> The exact benefits of travel treads are based on their model, including the number of rerolls they provide per day, as follows.</p>	Magic	13	46500	L	null	null	null	ARM	117
Aeon Stones, Silver Lemniscate	<p>Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.<br/> Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).<br/> Most aeon stones (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).<br/> Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.</p>	Magic	14	65000	null	null	null	null	ARM	110
Boardroom Attire (Worn)	<p>This elegant tailored suit resembles a platinum AbadarCorp travel suit and has the same statistics as that armor.

Ring Of Resistance, Mk 4 (Worn)	<p>This ring grants you magic protection against attacks and effects to which you are particularly vulnerable. You gain an enhancement bonus to saving throws with your lowest base saving throw bonus. If two or three of your base saving throw bonuses are tied for lowest value, you select which category gains this bonus when you first put on the ring, and this choice does not change unless a different base saving throw bonus later becomes your lowest bonus.

Spell Gem, 5Th	<p>Consisting of one or more lattices of carefully arranged lines of rare metal and bits of precious stone in a silicon casing, each lattice in a spell gem is encoded with magical writings equivalent to the casting of a single, specific spell. Holding a spell gem in your hand unlocks little-used portions of your mind, granting you the ability to temporarily cast the spell encoded within the gem without using up your daily spell slots. You must hold the spell gem in your hand throughout the spell’s casting time and must spend at least a standard action using the spell gem, even if the spell’s casting time is shorter. Each spell stored within a spell gem can be cast only once, after which the magic encoded within the spell gem’s lattice is forever expended.<br/> Only spellcasters are capable of using spell gems—if you aren’t a spellcaster, you’re unable to make use of the knowledge that the gem unlocks. You don’t need to know the spell within a spell gem to use it, but the spell must be on your class’s spell list (or have otherwise been added to your spell list) and you must have a high enough key ability score to cast it. If the spell gem’s item level is higher than your caster level, once you’ve spent the full casting time of the spell, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the spell gem’s item level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell remains within the gem and you can attempt to use it again.<br/> To craft a spell gem, you have to know the spell you’re encoding into the gem. If a spell requires expensive materials as part of its casting (such as raise dead), you must provide those while crafting the gem, and the gem’s price is increased by the price of the components. You can create larger, compound spell gems with multiple spells in multiple lattices, with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it. Such spell gems can be used to cast only one spell at a time.</p>	Magic	14	10600	L	null	null	null	CRB	224
Tiara Of Translocation, Mk 1 (Worn)	<p>This shimmering circlet is crafted from rare metals and seems to bend and distort light around it, creating an eerie halo of light around your brow. Once per day, a tiara of translocation allows you to teleport yourself and up to 5 additional creatures, functioning as a teleport spell. Unlike the spell, the range at which you can use this item varies based upon its model, as described below. You cannot use a tiara of translocation to travel between the planes, and it refuses to function at all while in the Drift. <table> <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>TELEPORTATION</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>Any point within 200 miles</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>Any point within 2,000 miles</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>Any point within the same star system</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 4</td><td>Any point within the same galaxy</td></tr> </table></p>	Magic	14	11750	L	null	null	null	CRB	224

Elemental Gem, Mk 5	<p>Each elemental gem contains one elemental from a specific elemental plane. The gem’s color indicates the sort of elemental contained within—air gems are transparent, earth gems are brown, fire gems are orange, and water gems are blue. As a standard action, you can crush the gem, destroying it. The contained elemental then appears as if you had cast a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144) of a level and caster level according to the gem’s type.</p>	Magic	15	16000	L	null	null	null	ARM	112
Figurine Of Wondrous Power, Plastic Sharpwing	<p>Each figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a creature no more than a few inches tall and long. As a standard action, you can speak the figurine’s command word to transform the figurine into a creature in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The figurine can’t change into a creature if it doesn’t have enough space to do so or if the environment can’t support the creature’s life functions. When the creature appears, it can act immediately on your turn. It understands and obeys your commands, and it understands Common but can’t speak. The creature considers your allies to be its allies and follows their orders when you aren’t able to give any.<br/> Each figurine in this entry can become a creature for up to 1 minute per day, though this duration does not need to be used continuously. After the figure has been in creature form for 1 minute, it reverts to figurine form and can’t be activated again for 24 hours. As a move action, you can dismiss the creature and return it to figurine form. The creature reverts to a figurine if killed. Although it can be healed while in creature form, the creature otherwise regains all its Hit Points 24 hours after its most recent activation. Therefore, if the creature is killed and reverts to figurine form, it can’t transform again for 24 hours.<br/> If you are within 30 feet of the creature when it returns to figurine form, the figurine appears in one of your empty hands or in your space (your choice). Otherwise, it reverts to figurine form as close to you as possible in its own space.<br/> A figurine of wondrous power becomes nonmagical if broken, losing its power to transform into a creature.</p>	Magic	15	100000	L	null	null	null	ARM	113
Polymorphic Serum, Mk 5	<p>Those unfamiliar with polymorphic serum often believe the churning, neon-green liquid to be toxic or radioactive at first glance. When created, each polymorphic serum is assigned a specific polymorphed form, as described by a polymorph spell of the serum’s level. All decisions regarding this polymorph form, such as whether it is a generic or a specific form, are determined when the serum is created. Any creature imbibing a polymorphic serum changes into the serum’s associated form for 2 hours × the serum’s mark (2 hours for mk 1, 4 hours for mk 2, and so on). If you are unwillingly subjected to a polymorphic serum (such as through a weapon with the injection special property), you can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level). If you fail, you can still dismiss the effect as normal for the polymorph spell.</p>	Magic	15	18000	null	null	null	null	COM	126
Psychic Inhibitor	<p>Crafted from shards of crystal mined in the Colonies and held together with an organic, waxy substance, a psychic inhibitor has the ability to disrupt telepathic communications. You can hold a psychic inhibitor in one hand and activate it once per day as a standard action by picturing a complex series of geometric shapes in your mind. When you do so, each creature with the limited telepathy or telepathy ability within 100 feet (including yourself) must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier) or have their mind flooded with unbearable psychic noise. Each affected creature loses its limited telepathy or telepathy ability and takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls, a –4 penalty to Will saving throws, and a –8 penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills for 1 hour. This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that succeeds at its save can’t be affected by the same psychic inhibitor for 1 week.<br/> A psychic inhibitor comes with four attuned psychic disinhibitors (these are created at the same time as the psychic inhibitor and are included in the price). A psychic disinhibitor is a flexible disk 1 inch in diameter that can be affixed to a creature’s skin (preferably near the brain) to make the creature immune to the attuned psychic inhibitor’s effects. A psychic disinhibitor counts as a worn magic item.</p>	Magic	15	120000	1	null	null	null	AA3	39

You don’t need to have prior knowledge of the location—you just zoom in on the desired point from the global view. Additionally, once per week, the globe allows you to use interplanetary teleport to transport yourself and other willing creatures touching the globe to the location you’re currently observing using the globe’s clairaudience/clairvoyance effect.

Eldritch Encephalon, Mk 3	<p>Eldritch encephalons were originally created in yah-thelgaad experiments when brain collectors sought to replicate the way they use the brains of deceased spellcasters, allowing other agents of the Dominion of the Black to also share brains among themselves. An eldritch encephalon is a lifeless, severed humanoid head inscribed with necromantic glyphs that run from just above each eye, over the scalp, and end at the base of the skull. A mass of slender, writhing tentacles extends from the neck or skull of the encephalon, often roiling and trembling as if attempting to grasp something that isn’t there. When placed on your shoulder, or on any patch of exposed skin that can support the weight of an average humanoid head, an eldritch encephalon burrows its tentacles into your flesh and merges with your physiology in a process that takes a full 24 hours to complete. Once attached, an encephalon counts as a worn magic item and can be sundered, but not disarmed. Once this process is completed, the command words to activate the encephalon are transmitted psychically to your brain, and the head seems to come to life as its runes begin to glow. The encephalon occasionally speaks of its own volition, espousing the thoughts and opinions of the spellcaster it was in life. You can never be bonded to more than one encephalon at a time, and removing one is a time-consuming process requiring a special necromantic ritual that takes several hours to perform. Any eldritch encephalon that has not been joined with a host creature for more than 12 days withers rapidly, disintegrating into dust. An eldritch encephalon allows you to cast a small selection of spells as spell-like abilities depending on the item’s model, using your character level as your caster level. The DC of any spell cast using an eldritch encephalon is equal to 10 + the level of the spell + your Charisma modifier.</p>	Magic	18	450000	L	null	null	null	DF04	48

Encryption Tattoo, Master	<p>The secretive members of the Android Abolitionist Front identify each other with invisible magical tattoos. When you are within 60 feet of a being with another encryption tattoo and activate your encryption tattoo with a code word as a move action, your tattoo becomes visible for 1 minute and glows faintly. The tattoo closely resembles the glowing circuit patterns prevalent on android skin, and is therefore particularly obvious on non-androids. The agent encryption tattoo is the standard type of encryption tattoo. Certain encryption tattoos, when activated with a different code word, also grant you damage reduction: operative encryption tattoos provide DR 5/—, provocateur encryption tattoos provide DR 10/—, and master encryption tattoos provide DR 15/—. This damage reduction doesn’t stack with any damage reduction you already have. The damage reduction lasts for the 1 minute your tattoo is visible.<br/> Although there is no limit on the number of times you can cause your encryption tattoo to appear, you can activate its power to gain DR only once per day.<br/> An encryption tattoo doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered.

Containment Tesseract	<p>A containment tesseract is a four-dimensional cube, about 6 inches on a side, with runes lining the surfaces. It is thought that technomancers unknown to recorded history created initial models during the Gap. Historians posit these devices were intended to imprison extraplanar entities, and that a creature trapped within one might have avoided the effects of the Gap. If that’s true, there could be a containment tesseract holding a being that knows truths lost to the current age.<br/> As a standard action, you can command the tesseract to imprison a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 19 + your key ability score modifier). A creature that has already been imprisoned in a containment tesseract can roll the saving throw twice and take the higher result. On a failure, the target disappears into the tesseract and remains inside, unharmed and unaware, until released. The tesseract can hold only one creature at a time.<br/> Alternatively, as a standard action, you can command the tesseract to release a creature within it. The released creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or become helpful toward you for 1 hour. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw acts according to its normal inclinations and desires.<br/> A containment tesseract accepts commands only twice per day.</p>	Magic	19	500000	1	null	null	null	ARM	112
Conqueror's Star Of The Headless Vesk	<p>Stories told by Veskarium warriors speak of an ancient Vesk captain named Harakoye, who was awarded the Conqueror’s Star, a coveted Veskarium military decoration, for slaying an overwhelming number of enemy soldiers in a glorious battle against all odds. Harakoye so prized the emblem, she slept with it hanging around her neck. But one night, when sleeping in the same barracks as her unit, Harakoye was betrayed by an assassin who had posed for months as a loyal comrade. As the assassin slit her throat, Harakoye awoke from slumber and grabbed the doshko she kept by her bedside. As the assassin continued to slash at Harakoye’s neck and stabbed out her eyes, Harakoye hacked away at him. It was not until her head was removed completely that Harakoye was finally slain, and even then, soldiers of the Veskarium claim her body rose once more, headless, to attack one final time, dealing a fatal blow to her assailant. The Conqueror’s Star of the Headless Vesk is an adamantine medallion set atop an eight-pointed star and molded into the form of a vesk hand clutching the bleeding heart of an enemy in its claws. It is spattered with Harakoye’s blood and affixed to a gore-soaked turquoise ribbon. No matter how much anyone attempts to clean the medal or the ribbon (even using magic), the blood spatter always reappears within 2d4 hours. While you are wearing the medallion, you gain 20 temporary Hit Points that replenish after 8 hours of rest. If you are surprised by an attack while wearing the Conqueror’s Star of the Headless Vesk, you can call any one weapon you own immediately into your hands as if it had the called weapon fusion. In addition, if you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by an attack while wearing the artifact, you can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the CR of the creature whose attack reduced you to 0 Hit Points + 5 if the attack was a critical hit) to be reduced to 1 Hit Point instead. Each time beyond the first that you activate this ability within 1 week, the save DC increases by 5. If you fail this Fortitude save, you can immediately make a melee attack against an enemy within your reach before you are reduced to 0 Hit Points. Unfortunately, wearing the artifact has a major drawback. Any time you are struck with a melee weapon with the wound or severe wound critical hit effect, the attacker acts as if they had rolled a 20 on the Wounding Weapons table (Starfinder Core Rulebook 183), and you must roll the Fortitude saving throw twice and take the worse result.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	L	null	null	null	DF04	51
Harmonic Reassembler	<p>While the true origin of this artifact was lost in the Gap, some believe it was created by a gnome inventor who sought to permanently reverse the course of the Bleaching that affects all of gnomekind. The Harmonic Reassembler is a large musical instrument comprising a series of glass bowls overlapping one another and set around a shaft of pure noqual. The bowls are spun by an internal engine, and a musician gently touches them to produce haunting tones, which can be adjusted by a series of pedals and levers that send mild electrical currents through the shaft. Some scholars believe the noqual shaft was selected for its ability to resist magical effects, allowing it to serve as a sort of nullifying “ground” for the instrument’s transformative effects. When certain chords are played on the Harmonic Reassembler by a trained musician, it can produce incredible magic. Before you can produce any magical effects with the Harmonic Reassembler, you must first learn one of the specific chords described below. Doing so takes 1 week of study and a successful DC 30 Profession (musician) check; if you are being taught the chord from someone who already knows it, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Once you know a chord, you can play it as a full action; an additional successful Profession (musician) check is required to produce the desired effect, as noted in each chord’s description. Playing a chord on the artifact is dangerous, as the magic can backfire if you aren’t a talented enough musician. You must be adjacent to the Harmonic Reassembler to play it, and you can include yourself as a target of its effects if you wish. Each effect produced by the artifact can target only living creatures that can hear the music, so each effect is sense-dependent. <strong>Chord of Baleful Transformation:</strong> Playing this chord requires a successful DC 34 Profession (musician) check. When you do so, you can choose up to four creatures within 30 feet (no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart) that can hear the Harmonic Reassembler to transform them into Small creatures of your choice. This effect functions as per the 6th-level version of mass baleful polymorph (Starfinder Alien Archive 2 148) with a Will saving throw DC of 29. The effect lasts for a maximum of 20 rounds as long you play the Harmonic Reassembler each round (a standard action); otherwise, the effect is immediately dispelled (unless you have chosen to make the duration permanent, as noted in the spell). If you fail the Profession (musician) check by 10 or more, you must attempt a DC 29 Will saving throw or be immediately and permanently transformed into a Small animal or similar beast, as per the final step of the 6th-level version of baleful polymorph (Starfinder Alien Archive 2 147). <strong>Chord of Disassembly:</strong> Playing this chord requires a successful DC 34 Profession (musician) check. When you do so, you can choose up to three creatures within 100 feet that can hear the Harmonic Reassembler to be affected as if they were struck by the ray produced by disintegrate (Fortitude DC 29 partial). If you fail the Profession (musician) check by 5 or more, you are affected by the disintegrate spell instead (and must attempt the same DC 29 Fortitude save). If you fail the Profession (musician) check by 10 or more, you take a –4 penalty to the saving throw.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	22	null	null	null	DF04	50

Vessel Of Hylax	<p>A vessel of Hylax is a bowl fashioned from carved chitin. Two are known to exist, both originating on the Liavaran moon Nchak. The vessels are ancient holy relics, their creation said to have occurred during the reign of a Forever Queen who ruled Nchak before the Gap. When the shirrens arrived in the Pact Worlds and showed great devotion to Hylax, the philosopher worms of Nchak, due to portents they and their queen had seen, sent one vessel to the shirren colony on Ilemchuuva. The relic was a gift intended to make Ilemchuuva another great center of Hylax worship.<br/> Oral tradition and recent academic research uphold each vessel’s most famous power. A creature that willingly drinks water from this vessel, with full knowledge of the outcome, immediately and irrevocably transforms into a new insectile form. The exact form manifested follows some obscure criteria that neither priests nor researchers understand. Most sapient creatures become shirrens or trox, with a rare few becoming another sapient insectile species, such as bolidas, dessamars, or formians. Other creatures transform into a variety of insectile forms, some closely resembling their former body shape. Elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be transformed, nor can any creature that can’t benefit from the mystic cure spell.<br/> A transformed creature recalls its former life and body. It retains any class features, feats, and skill ranks it formerly had. Its class, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses are also unchanged. The creature loses the traits of its former species and gains those of the new one, including recalculating ability scores and base Hit Points as a member of its new species. Abilities reliant upon features the new species lacks are retrained as part of the transformation. Any gear the creature carries or wears at the time of transformation adapts to the creature’s new form.<br/> A vessel of Hylax can also be used to cast the reincarnate spell on a sapient creature, acting as the soul beacon that spell requires without being consumed during the spell. The reincarnate becomes a shirren or trox, or more rarely, some other sapient insectile species. When returned to life with a vessel of Hylax, a person suffers none of the drawbacks of the reincarnate spell, reviving with full vigor.<br/> A vessel of Hylax can be destroyed only if a sapient creature the bowl has transformed fills the bowl with its blood, then uses a wish or miracle to reverse the transformation while simultaneously wishing the bowl polluted. The polluted bowl must then be destroyed (AC 11; immune to cold, electricity, and piercing; hardness 25; 55 HP). If the polluted vessel remains undestroyed, it can be reconsecrated with a ritual that requires the remove affliction spell (DC 31). A vessel of Hylax is 1 bulk.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	1	null	null	null	A!03	45
Atrocite Sphere	<p>An Atrocite Sphere is a dull, dark globe 3 inches in diameter. Each of the several known Atrocite Spheres is thought to have spontaneously appeared from the void when an atrocite (a supernatural agent of the Devourer) emerged into the galaxy. The Atrocite Sphere must adjust to your soul by floating 3 inches above your head for 24 hours. If the sphere stops floating above you for more than 1 minute, it must readjust to you. The sphere can float above you while you’re prone or unconscious, but it stops doing so if you die. After it adjusts to you, the sphere exudes a slight pull, like gravity.<br/> While the Atrocite Sphere floats above you, you gain DR 10/— and energy resistance 10 against all energy types. If you gain a higher value in one of these defenses from another source, that value increases by 2. When it blocks damage, the sphere briefly flashes with crimson light that resembles a black hole’s accretion disc.<br/> When you take Hit Point damage from an attack or effect a foe created, as a reaction you can redirect some of the damage dealt to you. When you do so, the sphere flashes with crimson light and pulses with gravity, knocking you prone. Divide the damage dealt to you in half. If your attacker is within 330 feet of you, it takes this damage as force damage, is knocked prone, and suffers any critical effect the attack inflicted, but it suffers no other effects. The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 20 + your Charisma modifier) to take half damage and avoid any critical effect. You take the remaining damage (though you get to apply your defenses to this damage normally).<br/> After you redirect damage with the Atrocite Sphere, you go berserk. This compulsion is a mind-affecting effect, but it works on any creature the sphere has adapted to, even if that creature is normally immune to such effects. While you are berserk, you gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls and a +3 morale bonus to damage rolls and Strength checks. You also gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to 3 times your level or CR, which remain only while you stay berserk. However, you take a –2 penalty to KAC and EAC. You can’t cast spells or use any skill or ability that requires concentration or patience. The only reactions you can take are attacks of opportunity. You consider no creature to be your ally, although you don’t consider erstwhile allies to be foes.<br/> On each of your turns while you’re berserk, you attack the opponent closest to you, moving or charging only if you need to do so to attack. You make a full attack if you can, using abilities or weapon special properties that facilitate making numerous attacks. When you make a full attack, you reduce the penalties for doing so by 1. If multiple opponents are equally close to you, you divide your attacks among them or include as many as you can in a full attack such as automatic fire.<br/> You cease being berserk if you lose consciousness or you’re aware of no other enemies. In addition, you can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw each time you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, ending the berserking episode if you succeed. When the episode ends, you are fatigued for as long as you were berserk.<br/> If you fail to reduce a significant enemy to 0 Hit Points while you’re berserk, the Atrocite Sphere provides none of its benefits to you for 24 hours.<br/> An Atrocite Sphere can be destroyed only by being tossed into a star, gas giant, black hole, or some equally massive gravitational phenomenon. Cultists of the Devourer say this annihilation is useless, since the spheres will continue to be born until reality itself dies.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	L	null	null	null	ARM	118
Book Of Unwritten Truths	<p>The Book of Unwritten Truths is a massive book of 528 metallic pages without images or words. According to legend, the book exists as a strange Material Plane connection to the Akashic Record, and information in the volume is presented through tactile means. However, the tome allows its readers to access information on only obscure topics. The axiomite curators of the library world of Athaeum have long sought this artifact as a capstone to their collection.<br/> If you can touch the Book of Unwritten Truths, you can read it. While you touch the book, you can take 20 on any skill check to recall knowledge, provided the DC to recall that knowledge is higher than 20. If you roll the check rather than taking 20, you gain a +10 insight bonus to the check. You can read the book to  recall knowledge using any skill, even if you are untrained in the associated skill. Once you gain information from the check, the book closes itself and can’t be used to gain knowledge using the same skill for 24 hours.<br/> Once per day, the book allows you to cast vision. You must spend the 1 Resolve Point required for the spell, but you are considered to automatically succeed at the caster level check. The book, rather than a computer, imparts the information the spell accesses.<br/> If you attempt to use the book to research the Gap, you gain 1 negative level. Each time you use the book thereafter, you must succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or gain 1 negative level. Someone who knows a secret lost to the Gap can write that truth in the Book of Unwritten Truths to convert it to a mundane tome with none of its powers.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	L	null	null	null	ARM	118
Possibility Timer	<p>Created at some point during the Ancient Azlanti Empire of lost Golarion, the Possibility Timer is a crystalline hourglass, but in place of sand flows shining, solidified fragments of time. This artifact allows users to manipulate time. (See page 118 of Starfinder Armory for rules on artifacts.)<br/> The artifact changes size to match the size of its user. Inverting the hourglass as a standard action activates it, allowing you to enact one of its effects via mental commands. Three times per day, you can activate the Possibility Timer to use haste or slow as a spell-like ability. The spell uses your level as its caster level, and the DC to resist the effect is equal to 20 + your Charisma modifier. In addition, once per week, you can activate the Possibility Timer to freeze time for everyone but you. When you do so, you can act normally for 1d4+1 rounds while no other creature can. While time is stopped, you are undetectable. You can’t take damage from your environment and ongoing effects, but neither can you damage other creatures. In addition, you can’t move, change, or harm objects you aren’t already carrying or wearing. The duration of effects you create are relative to you and can affect only you and the objects you’re already carrying or wearing. Effects targeting other specific creatures or objects have no effect but still consume charges or uses. If an effect that you create doesn’t target a specific creature and has a lasting duration, the time spent in stopped time counts against that duration, but if part of the effect’s duration remains after the time stop, the effect continues for that amount of time.<br/> Up to five times per day, you can attempt to meddle with a creature’s personal timeline while holding the Possibility Timer. To do so, you name or otherwise precisely identify a target and concentrate on that target for 10 minutes to shunt it forward or backward in time. If the target isn’t on the same plane as you, this power fails. Otherwise, the first meddling shunts the target by 1d3 seconds with no saving throw; the target experiences this first effect as a brief skip in time or an intense feeling of déjà vu. A single target can be affected only once every 24 hours. When you meddle with a target you have affected before, she can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + twice the number of times the target has previously been successfully affected) to negate the effect. The second success shunts the target in time by 1 round, the third success 1 minute, the fourth 10 minutes, the fifth 1 hour, the sixth 8 hours, and the seventh 24 hours. A target shunted forward in time is effectively gone for the duration, while a creature shunted backward can effectively be in two places at once, with everyone suddenly remembering the double’s existence.<br/> Once you have successfully employed the Possibility Timer’s time-meddling power 20 times, you can choose up to seven targets, activate the artifact, and travel into their pasts. While in the past, you can’t alter significant events (such as births and deaths), but you can coax acquaintances of a target to take different courses of actions that might have rippling effects on the targets’ lives. The targets retain their original memories but might instantly find themselves in an “alternate” reality where much of what they know is wrong. While this might seem more disorienting than harmful, certain changes can lead targets into very dangerous situations. Once you have visited a target’s past, you can’t return to that point in the target’s timeline.<br/> To destroy the Possibility Timer, you must throw it into the same black hole three times. The first two times, it disappears over the event horizon and it reappears somewhere else in the same galaxy. If you have affected at least 50 targets with the Possibility Timer’s time-meddling power, you can sense the general direction of the artifact.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	L	null	null	null	AT03	44
Trafodi Paradox	<p>The Trafodi Paradox is an intricately carved orb of red stone or coral, a foot in diameter. The carving forms a multilayered lattice within the sphere. Despite its substance and size, the Trafodi Paradox is very light.<br/> During the conquest of Vesk-2, the vesk invaders ignored the pleas of the planet’s natives and ransacked the ancient vault containing the Trafodi Paradox. The inhabitants of Vesk2 had no written records of the sphere—only an oral legend that it was brought from the sky and sealed away during the Gap. A vesk warlord kept the artifact on Vesk-2, where it stayed for several generations before it came to the attention of high-ranking members of the Veskarium. The artifact was loaded onto a Veskarian military transport to be taken to Vesk Prime for further study. Distress signals recorded shortly thereafter indicate that vessel ran afoul of the Swarm, and no one has seen that starship or the Trafodi Paradox since. Those who have studied the accounts of Veskarian mystics who examined the artifact speculate that it is a transportation device but that it is either malfunctioning or designed for a truly alien and magically gifted species.<br/> As a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can activate the Trafodi Paradox. The artifact darkens and shrinks as its internal lattice realigns. It activates just before the start of your next turn, provided you’re still conscious and holding the sphere. When you activate the Trafodi Paradox, it becomes a singularity in a square of your choice in your space or in a space adjacent to you. The singularity’s physical manifestation is tiny, but it is considered to occupy a 5-foot cube.<br/> When the singularity appears, creatures within 1 mile of the singularity feel drawn to it. A creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or use all its actions to move as quickly as possible toward the singularity. Although this is a mindaffecting effect, creatures immune to such effects still feel the pull and might seek the source of this attraction despite no compulsion to do so.<br/> Creatures within 120 feet of the singularity must succeed at a DC 25 Athletics check or a DC 20 Strength check to move farther from it, and even then does so at one-quarter its speed.<br/> Each round, at the start of your turn, the singularity performs a special combat maneuver with a +30 bonus to the attack roll. If a creature is within 120 feet of the singularity, compare the result of this attack roll to the creature’s KAC + 8. If the maneuver is successful, that creature moves 5 feet toward the singularity, plus 1 foot per point the singularity’s result exceeded the creature’s KAC + 8; round the distance up to the nearest 5 feet. Huge or smaller unattended objects move 30 feet toward the singularity at the start of each of your turns, moving an additional 10 feet per size category below Medium or 10 fewer feet per size category above Medium.<br/> A creature or object that enters the singularity’s space is sucked into the void. While inside, a creature can take no actions other than a full action to escape, which requires a successful DC 30 Athletics check or DC 25 Strength check. A creature that ends its turn inside the singularity takes 5d10 force damage unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Will save to take half damage; if it succeeds by 5 or more, the creature negates the damage entirely. The creature that activated the artifact gains a +5 circumstance bonus to this saving throw. The amount of damage dealt by the void increases by 5d10 each round. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, the creature’s body is utterly destroyed.<br/> A creature that succeeds at a Will save within the singularity senses a presence in the void. In myriad voices, one of which the listener can understand, the presence offers salvation from the crushing gravity. A creature that accepts this salvation leaves the void, transported to another location in the galaxy or among the planes. Upon escaping in this way, a creature regains half of the Hit Points it lost to the singularity. Escapees with strong emotional attachments to one another often arrive in the same location, while enemies rarely land in the same place.<br/> The singularity created by the Trafodi Paradox lasts 13 minutes. When the singularity ends, the artifact disappears. Roll 1d20 as the control and 1d20 as the determiner. If the determiner is higher than the control, the Trafodi Paradox reappears in the possession of the creature that last activated it. Otherwise, the artifact could reappear anywhere in the galaxy. The creature that last activated the artifact can sense in which direction the artifact lies, provided the object isn’t sealed in an area lined with starmetal.<br/> The Trafodi Paradox can be destroyed only if it consumes the last member of the species that created it.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	L	null	null	null	ARM	119
Ungarato	<p>Ungarato is one of the most powerful known relics of lost Golarion, though even greater artifacts have occasionally appeared throughout Absalom Station’s history. Ungarato, also called the All-Consuming Killer or the Gun of Gluttony, is known to be one of the Alara’hai, seven weapons of nearly divine magical power that were also referred to as the Seven Blades of Conviction or the Seven Swords of Sin. Although the fates of the other six Alara’hai remain unknown, these epithets imply that Ungarato was once a sword of some kind, though when, how, and why this blade was reforged into a powerful machine gun with a bayonet is one of the relic’s greatest mysteries.<br/> Much of Ungarato’s history is lost, though scholars have shown that the weapon was created in its original form thousands of years before the Gap. The Arcanamirium’s most learned esotericists agree that Ungarato’s origin lies in ancient Thassilon, an empire ruled by spellcasting tyrants called runelords, which collapsed at the beginning of the period of Golarion’s history known as the Age of Darkness. It is also generally agreed that the weapon’s intended wielder was the Runelord of Gluttony, but a ferocious warrior stole the blade before it ever reached the runelord’s hands. This barbarian warlord later became the champion of the runelord’s successor, and it is believed that Ungarato took its name from this champion. Nothing definitive is known of Ungarato’s fate after the fall of Thassilon.<br/> Ungarato has a distinct appearance that is unlike any other specific model of longarm. It has a misty, spectral quality, but the weapon is as solid as any other. Ungarato functions as a paragon X-gen gun, and its bayonet is a molecular rift dueling sword, both of which have the ghost killer fusion. Two hands are required to wield Ungarato, and proficiency with basic melee weapons and heavy weapons is necessary to use the weapon without penalty for melee and ranged attacks, respectively.<br/> Ungarato glows with a bright, sickly green color whenever there is a creature of the undead type within 50 feet of its wielder, though the weapon gives no indication of the direction or number of undead within that range. Each time its wielder suffers the full effects of a critical hit (when damage reduction, energy resistance, or some other effect does not reduce the damage dealt or prevent any critical hit effect), Ungarato gains 1 point of viciousness. Whenever Ungarato scores a critical hit, it automatically spends 1 point of viciousness (if it has any) and adds the severe wound critical hit effect to the critical damage dealt. Any unused points of viciousness fade at the rate of 1 per hour. Ungarato also restores 10 Hit Points to its wielder (functioning as per mystic cure) each time it scores a critical hit (whether or not it has any points of viciousness).<br/> Ungarato is a unique artifact of extreme power and legendary reputation; as such, the weapon is effectively priceless and cannot simply be purchased. Indeed, its current owner and whereabouts are unknown, though Ungarato is widely believed to have resurfaced recently somewhere on Absalom Station. Legend claims that Ungarato was once sentient and held great powers that only functioned in the hands of a Thassilonian runelord, but there’s no modern evidence to support either claim. Similarly, it is believed that only the rightful Runelord of Gluttony can break the weapon; Ungarato is otherwise impervious to damage or destruction.</p>	Magic	20	Priceless	2	null	null	null	DS01	53
Signal Jammer	<p>This handheld device, originally designed by the Stewards for military uses, is used by corporations and criminals alike. Signal jammers are available at any item level from 1 to 20 and can be purchased for a price equal to 100 credits × the square of the item level of the jammer. When activated, a signal jammer interrupts broadcast signals within 4 miles. If attached to a larger broadcasting station (such as those found aboard a starship), the range increases to 12 miles. A signal jammer blocks all communication devices from sending and receiving broadcasts. Each signal jammer is designed to affect one specific broadcasting medium (such as radio or wireless). You can attempt a Computers or Engineering check to bypass a signal jammer’s effects or to determine the location of the jammer. The DC to bypass a signal jammer is 15 + the signal jammer’s level, and attempting this check takes 1 minute.</p>	Tech	Varies	Level squared × 100	L	12	1/10 minute	null	CRB	221

Comm Unit, Personal	<p>A personal comm unit is pocket-sized device that combines a minor portable computer (treat as a tier-0 computer with no upgrades or modules) and a cellular communication device, allowing wireless communication with other comm units in both audio- and text-based formats at planetary range (see page 272). A personal comm unit also includes a calculator, a flashlight (increases the light level one step in a 15-foot cone), and several entertainment options (including games and access to any local infospheres). You can upgrade a personal comm unit to function as some other devices (such as full computers and scanners) by spending credits equal to 110% of the additional device’s price.<br/> Comm units that function at system-wide and unlimited ranges aren’t as portable; they include built-in generators that provide the necessary amount of power. Short-term use of these units can be purchased in most major settlements (see page 234).<br/> See page 430 for more about Pact Worlds communications.</p>	Tech	1	7	L	80	1/hour	1	CRB	218
Detonator	<p>This conical device primes and detonates explosives (including grenades) with a push of a button. Programming a detonator to a specific package of explosives takes 1 minute, after which the detonator can be triggered in one of several ways. The detonator can be set to ignite its payload with the simple press of a button (no action), a four-digit command code (a move action), or a complex input method, such as scanning your retina or thumbprint (a full action). You choose the triggering method when setting the detonator. A detonator detonates its payload only if it is within 500 feet, but some detonators can make use of signal-boosting technologies at the risk of becoming vulnerable to countermeasures like signal jammers and other effects. Explosives have the same price, effect, and weight as grenades (see page 183). If you successfully set an explosive on a stationary object with a detonator using the Engineering skill, the explosive’s damage ignores half of the object’s hardness.</p>	Tech	1	150	L	5	1/use	1	CRB	218

An emergency beacon’s transmissions have a range of 100 miles over flat terrain, but this range is halved in forests or hills and quartered in mountainous terrain and underwater. Alternatively, an emergency beacon can be hooked up to a starship or vehicle’s communications system, in which case its usage increases to 1 charge per hour and its range matches that of the communications array of the vehicle or starship.</p>	Tech	1	100	L	20	Varies	null	ARM	102

Voice Distorter	<p>Kasathas who turn to crime, as well as those who value anonymity, sometimes wear masks that conceal their identities. A voice distorter worn over the mouth converts the user’s voice into an unrecognizable and obviously artificial tone. Any check attempted to identify the wearer’s voice takes a –5 penalty, and such identification can succeed only by relying on speech patterns, distinguishing phrases, and other idiosyncrasies of the wearer’s speech rather than the sound of the voice itself.<br/> If the distorted voice is recorded, a character can remove the distortion and reveal the speaker’s original voice.

Bug Snare	<p>A reusable battlefield trap that SDF soldiers deploy to secure locations and encampments against wild animals and smaller Swarm foes, a bug snare is four large metallic claws that extend outward from a central point and snap shut when disturbed. As a full action, you can set a bug snare at an intersection to cover a 5-foot radius. The next creature that steps into that radius sets off the trap and must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or take 1d4 piercing damage and gain the entangled condition until it (or an adjacent ally) can extricate itself with a successful DC 14 Strength check as a standard action. An included wireless remote control can be used to disarm the trap from 15 feet away as a move action. You can attempt to hide a bug snare from view with a Stealth check (this check is opposed by the Perception check of a potential target). You can attach a bug snare to a fixed object (such as a nearby tree) with a length of cable line, rendering a trapped creature immobile, but this grants any creature attempting to spot a hidden bug snare a +2 circumstance bonus to its Perception check.<br/> A bug snare requires two hands to hold and set.

Crash Pad	<p>A popular safety accessory for stunt performers, competitive climbers, and others who regularly risk falling or sustaining high-impact injuries, a crash pad is a rectangular packet of polyfluid worn on a belt or clipped to armor. A built-in altimeter can be set to customize the distance fallen before the crash pad activates, but it defaults to 15 feet. Further, an included accelerometer can be set to account for any acceleration that could prove harmful to a wearer. When you’re wearing a crash pad and fall or suffer an impact from your body being moved through space, such as in a vehicle collision, the crash pad activates, flash manufacturing ablative, protective foam and surrounding you with it. You reduce the number of dice of damage you take due to the triggering impact by three dice, taking no damage if this reduction leaves no dice to be rolled for the damage. You then halve any remaining damage you take from the triggering impact, rounded down. A used crash pad container can be recycled, allowing you to craft a new one with the usual 10% discount for having scavenged parts.</p>	Tech	2	150	L	null	null	null	DF03	43
Datapad	<p>Datapads are among the most common handheld computers (Core Rulebook 213) and are ubiquitous in homes, manufacturing settings, and offices. Datapads require at least one hand to use. Nearly all datapads also incorporate a comm unit (which includes a microphone and speaker) along with several other functions, such as infosphere connectivity and data storage. Datapads can record simple audio and video (though not in high enough resolution to serve as proof of recorded events in most courts of law), store thousands of hours of recordings, play games, track time and set time-based alarms, act as word processors, and perform numerous other minor data processing and entertainment functions.<br/> All datapads have light bulk, and most are tier 1 computers with the miniaturization upgrade. Tier 2 and higher datapads are generally used only by the wealthy elites or technological sophisticates due to the additional miniaturization technology involved, but they are more powerful than many stationary computers while still fitting comfortably in one hand. Datapads can have computer modules and countermeasures installed at the usual additional costs (Core Rulebook 216). For example, most datapads in military or industrial use have the hardened upgrade.<br/> Saboteurs and spies frequently disguise eavesdropping devices or explosives as ordinary datapads, knowing that the datapads’ universal use means they won’t raise suspicion.</p>	Tech	2	55	L	20	1/hour	1	ARM	100
Diagnostic Lozenge	<p>This smooth, thumb-sized device activates automatically when it is inside a living creature. You can implant a diagnostic lozenge subdermally in a willing or unconscious creature with a successful DC 20 Medicine check, or a creature can choose to swallow one. An activated diagnostic lozenge steers itself into a creature’s tissue and extrudes several filaments to monitor its status, broadcasting information on a predetermined wireless frequency to a designated receiver, such as a datapad or comm unit, as long as the receiver is within 1 mile of the lozenge. The diagnostic lozenge broadcasts the creature’s direction and distance relative to the receiver, as well as any of the following conditions that are affecting the creature: dead, dying, frightened, nauseated, panicked, sickened, stable, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. A single receiver can accept information from up to six different diagnostic lozenges simultaneously. When a diagnostic lozenge runs out of charges, it breaks down into harmless components that eventually pass out of the creature’s body. Diagnostic lozenges can’t normally be safely removed once activated.</p>	Tech	2	175	null	20	1/hour	null	ARM	101

Evenfire Unit	<p>Crafted of chemicals found on sweltering jungle worlds, this dull-brown cylindrical unit is no larger than a datapad. When an evenfire unit is activated, an electric current causes the chemicals to emit steady heat, but not light, within a 30-foot radius. Over 1 minute, the temperature of this area increases by 60° F, to a maximum of 80° F. The effects of multiple active evenfire units do not stack. This heat dissipates once the unit is shut off. An evenfire’s heat is consistent throughout the area and is no hotter closer to the unit than at the edge of its area of effect. Anyone in the heated area gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental cold dangers. In moderate or strong winds (Core Rulebook 400), an evenfire’s temperature increase is reduced to 30° F, and the circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves is reduced to +1.<br/> In severe or stronger winds, an evenfire unit provides no temperature increase or save bonus.</p>	Tech	2	550	L	20	2/hour	null	ARM	103
Grappler	<p>A grappler is a high-tech anchoring device that can be attached to a cable line as a move action. The cable line can instead be threaded through the grappler, which takes 1 minute but adds the cable line’s hardness and HP to the hardness and HP of the grappler (and vice versa). A grappler has clamps that can slide from its base along a cable line attached to it, allowing it to be climbed as easily as a knotted rope (see Athletics on page 136).<br/> You can attach a grappler through which a cable line is threaded to an immobile object that’s at least 5 feet in width with a ranged attack against AC 5. If the grappler is fired at a moving object or a smaller object, you must hit that object’s KAC + 8 to attach the grappler to the object. After it’s attached, the grappler remains anchored until either you give a release command as a move action, the grappler is pried free with an Athletics check equal to the attack roll you made to attach it, or the grappler is destroyed. If a cable line attached to or threaded through a grappler is destroyed but the grappler itself was not damaged, the cable line is destroyed, but the grappler is unharmed. In this case, the grappler loses the excess hardness and HP that a threaded cable line added to it.<br/> You can also target a creature with the grappler. This is resolved as a grapple combat maneuver, but a creature struck with the grappler can still use its hands, and its movement is only restricted to remain within range of the length of the grappler’s cable. In addition to the normal rules for escaping a grapple, the target can pry itself loose with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to your attack roll to grapple the target). Or, it can perform a sunder combat maneuver (see page 246) against the grappler. Even if the combat maneuver doesn’t destroy the attached cable, the creature escapes the grapple.<br/> A grappler can be thrown as a grenade or set over the muzzle of a ranged weapon that targets KAC, in which case it has half the normal range increment of the weapon, and you use any weapon proficiency and bonuses to attack you have with that weapon. A grappler can be reused.</p>	Tech	2	700	L	20	1/minute	null	CRB	219
Heatsink Cravat	<p>This garment is worn over the exterior of armor, often around the neck or head. Woven from golden nanotubes, a heatsink cravat converts heat energy into cold.

Holoshroud	<p>This loose mesh of wire and miniature holographic projectors is used to disguise the presence of creatures or objects. Holoshroud comes in 10-foot-by-10-foot square sheets. When you hide under an activated holoshroud, you gain a +2 insight bonus to Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering yourself with holoshroud is a full action requiring a successful DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the holoshroud and do not gain its bonus to Stealth checks). You have the entangled condition when using a holoshroud, except you do not take a penalty to initiative or Stealth checks from this condition. Taking off a holoshroud is a move action, or you can take off the holoshroud as part of the move action to stand up from a prone position. A creature with the blindsense ability ignores the effect of a holoshroud. You cannot hide under a holoshroud that is not activated; if the holoshroud runs out of charges while you are underneath it, you are visible as normal.<br/> You can spend 1 minute covering a Medium or smaller object with a holoshroud, making it appear to be a natural part of the surrounding terrain. For example, you can conceal a hoverbike as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two holoshrouds. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five holoshrouds and takes 10 minutes of work. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 holoshrouds and takes 1 hour of work.

Ion Tape	<p>Ion tape is a ribbon of material tightly wound around a spindle. A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a human hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. It has a weak adhesive that keeps the tape in place when wrapped around an object. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zipstick; see page 109), the tape bonds into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon state, at which point it can be torn easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds. The uses for ion tape are many: it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.</p>	Tech	3	275	L	null	null	null	ARM	105

Miniature Sun	<p>A photonic inducer set in a brass-frame inset with glass similar to a lantern, a miniature sun is a portable light that exudes an area of bright light in a 30-foot radius. Thanks to a comfortable insulated handle, it requires only one hand to hold. After 1 minute of use, the exterior of a miniature sun becomes incredibly hot to the touch. When it is this hot, you can use a miniature sun as an improvised melee weapon that deals 1d3 fire damage, but each successful attack made in this way deals twice as much damage to the item, ignoring hardness.<br/> A miniature sun requires only one hand to operate, uses a battery, and consumes 1 charge per each hour of use (or fraction thereof).</p>	Tech	3	1200	1	20	1/hour	1	DF01	52
Multiverse Mirror	<p>Until it is activated, a multiverse mirror functions as normal full-length mirror. When activated, the reflective surface vibrates slightly, blurring the image. Once per day, you can spend 1 minute focusing on an activated mirror while contemplating a skill in which you have no ranks. As you do so, the image comes into focus, showing you a different version of yourself (presumably from an alternate reality) who is trained in that skill. The quantum energy released via the mirror briefly entangles you with this parallel self. Until the next time you take a full night’s rest, you can attempt one check with the chosen skill as if you had a number of ranks in that skill equal to your level. For that same period of time, the first time you roll a natural 20 for a skill check in a skill you are trained in, you must reroll that check and take the second result.</p>	Tech	3	1300	10	null	null	null	3C02	51
Portable Grinder	<p>Based on protocite reclaimers, this grinder has flat-toothed discs that interlock and rotate toward one another. A multistage mechanism allows these grinders to break material down into junk or polyfluid. The initial stage renders 1 bulk of technological items into 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment suitable as a target for some spells, such as battle junkbot. Further grinding produces polyfluid that flows into a swappable tank that itself weighs 1 bulk empty. Polyfluid can be gleaned from both analog and technological items. In any case, the material you produce is worth 10% of the original item’s value. The weight of the polyfluid produced is determined by that monetary value. A portable grinder requires a battery. It takes 1 charge and 1 minute to grind 1 bulk of items into junk. Another charge and minute are required to produce polyfluid.</p>	Tech	3	1500	2	null	null	null	DF03	44

White-Noise Generator	<p>This small box produces random signals across multiple auditory and subauditory spectra. An activated white-noise generator increases the DC of sound-based Perception checks by 4 within 100 feet of the device. This increase is reduced by 1 for each additional 100 feet. The increase is doubled for checks that rely on technological listening, such as with a drone or microphone. </p>	Tech	3	1350	1	20	1/10 minutes	null	ARM	109
Anykey	<p>An anykey is a lock-picking device, consisting of a handle and a thin metal strip. As a standard action, you can insert the strip into a physical lock and activate the anykey. Doing so causes the device to analyze the lock and extrude polyfluid into the mechanism. The fluid then hardens. This process creates a key that reduces the DC of Engineering checks to open that lock by 10. Resetting the anykey takes a standard action. An anykey comes with a charger that can take a standard battery and that holds the device when it’s not in use. Each use of the anykey, including resetting it, takes 1 charge.</p>	Tech	4	1750	L	null	null	null	DF03	43
Domestic Drone, Deckhand	<p>This Small drone is designed to provide basic assistance aboard a starship or other large vessel, including supplemental computation for navigation or astrogation. Most deckhand drones resemble a squat box with stubby, clawed feet that allow it to keep its orientation in zero-g. A deckhand drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the climbing claws and tool arm (fire extinguisher) mods instead of the stealth drone’s normal initial mods. If an activated deckhand drone is accessible to a creature attempting a Piloting check to navigate, that creature reduces the time needed to plot a course by half (generally from 10 minutes to 5 minutes).

Domestic Drone, Mule	<p>This Medium quadrupedal drone is designed to act as a mount and carry heavy loads, just as mules and other beasts of burden are used throughout the galaxy. Most mule drones resemble metallic quadrupeds with overlarge hooves. A mule drone acts as the combat drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the riding saddle and speed mods instead of the combat drone’s normal initial mods. Any Small or smaller creature can ride your mule drone, and the mule drone can be customized to support a specific Medium creature (normally you, if you are Medium); refitting the riding saddle to accommodate a different Medium creature takes 1 day and 100 UPBs.

Jammer Charge	<p>A jammer charge can be set as an explosive with the Engineering skill (with a detonator) or thrown like a grenade. When it detonates, a jammer charge silently releases a pulse of magnetic energy that interferes with broadcasting electronics. Computers and video cameras (such as security cameras and the scanners found on page 107 of Starfinder Armory) within the 15-foot blast radius become nonfunctional for 30 seconds, losing both their recording and displaying capabilities. Enemies, such as security guards, typically have no way to detect the detonation itself, but they may become suspicious if their video feeds are reduced to static for no apparent reason. Any video recording, data saving, or file transferring that would happen during the 30-second duration is interrupted and canceled, but data that may have existed on the cameras or computers before the grenade was detonated still exist, and regular functions resume after the 30-second duration ends. Like a grenade, a jammer charge is consumed upon detonation.</p>	Tech	4	375	1	null	null	null	DF03	53

Mechakata	<p>This lionlike model can let out a tiny roar with a push of a button on its remote control or a computer with an added module that allows you to control it. A mechakata functions as a 1st-level mechanic’s combat drone, except it is Small and has no initial mods, no weapon mounts, no feats, and no ability to gain drone mods. Its skill unit is always Athletics. It cannot speak, but it does understand one language (chosen by you at time of purchase). You control it as if you were a 1st-level mechanic. A mechakata has a bite attack that deals 1d4 nonlethal piercing damage, and it is proficient with its bite attack (but it does not gain specialization with its bite attack). In addition, it can carry an item of light bulk or less in its jaws. It cannot make bite attacks while it is holding an item in its mouth.<br/> The mechakata uses a nonreplaceable battery that has 20 charges, and it uses 1 charge per hour it is activated.

Proximity Helmet	<p>This open-faced, blue polymer helmet includes a nylon strap and adjustable tinted visor capable of hiding all but your mouth and chin. The interior of the tinted faceplate provides a heads-up display when activated, and while the helmet is activated, its external motion sensors pick up on sudden movements and subtle visual cues, granting you a +2 insight bonus to Perception checks to notice moving targets within 60 feet. A secondary setting on the helmet adds an audible alarm that creates a chirping sound near your ear whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet, although a creature undetectable to normal vision (such as an invisible creature) does not trigger the alarm. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door and each substantial interposing wall.

Purifying Puck	<p>This circular device resembles the sort of tiny cleaning drone seen aboard space stations and larger vessels, but it has no independent programming. Law-enforcement officers use purifying pucks to clean up areas after they deploy smoke grenades and similar effects. As a standard action, you can activate a purifying puck and slide it across the ground a maximum of 30 feet (difficult terrain reduces this distance to 15 feet, at the GM’s discretion). The purifying puck then sucks in all smoke and vapors within a 20-foot-radius spread over the next 4 rounds, completely dispersing the effect (such as from a smoke grenade or the fog cloud spell). If the radius of an effect is smaller than 20 feet, the time it takes a purifying puck to disperse the effect is reduced proportionally. If the effect contains any toxins (such as a cloud of poisonous gas), the time is doubled. A purifying puck can’t disperse an effect that has a radius larger than 20 feet.</p>	Tech	4	2000	L	40	1/round	1	PWD	198
Replenigel Megavitamin	<p>Replenigel is a nutritional gelatin interwoven with nanites that bolster the immune system. Originally designed by Abadarcorp during the war between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, replenigel is intended to provide a soldier with all of their daily nutritional needs and an added resistance to afflictions, while digesting slowly enough to require a soldier to eat only once per day. To minimize packaging costs, Abadarcorp commonly shipped replenigel to the front lines in 50-pound blocks that, unappetizingly, resembled marbled sulfur. After the conflict with the Veskarium ceased, the corporation found itself with a surplus of replenigel cubes and no way to sell them. A particularly savvy marketing executive realized that subtle tweaks to the product’s aesthetics could have a dramatic impact on its commercial viability. After extensive focus-group testing, Abadarcorp created Nutrimanders, reshaping the gelatin into sizable, 1-pound megavitamins molded to look like skittermanders and available in various artificial flavors and colors. It takes 5 minutes to consume a replenigel megavitamin. You gain 10 temporary Hit Points and a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against diseases and poisons for the next 24 hours. In addition, you don’t need to eat food or water for 24 hours. If you subsist on replenigel megavitamins for 5 consecutive days, you must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save at the end of that fifth day and on each subsequent consecutive day you continue to eat these megavitamins; the bonus from the megavitamin doesn’t apply to this save. Failure means you develop a waxy sheen on your skin that makes you smell vaguely like a fermented version of the flavor of megavitamin you most recently consumed. Your skin remains this way for 1d4 days, during which time you take a –4 penalty to all Charisma-based skill checks; if you consume another megavitamin during this time, the duration is increased by 1 day.</p>	Tech	4	300	L	null	null	null	DF04	48

Warning Wire, Mk 1	<p>This 50 feet of thin, nearly invisible wire is spooled around a dull-gray, flat metal cylinder. When any amount of the wire is unspooled and the cylinder is activated, the wire becomes exceptionally sensitive to vibration. The wire is often wrapped around valuable belongings or stretched as a trip wire across a doorway. When the activated wire is moved or touched, the cylinder emits a piercing alarm (though you can set it to send a silent alarm wirelessly to a comm unit or datapad instead). Noticing the warning wire requires a successful Perception check with a DC equal to 20 + the level of the warning wire, and bypassing it without setting it off usually requires a successful Acrobatics check at the same DC, though the GM might adjust the DC higher or lower as circumstances dictate. You can twist the cylinder in a preset pattern as a move action, deactivating the alarm and respooling the wire around the cylinder. <table> <tr><th>MODEL</th><th>LEVEL</th><th>DC TO NOTICE</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>4</td><td>24</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>8</td><td>28</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>12</td><td>32</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 4</td><td>16</td><td>36</td></tr> </table></p>	Tech	4	2000	L	40	1/hour	null	ARM	109
Acclimation Torc	<p>This simple metal band attaches to the collar area of your space suit, suit of armor, or other set of clothes. When activated as a standard action, an acclimation torc places your respiratory system and your digestive system in a form of temporal stasis, while still keeping you alive. Essentially, your need to eat, drink, and breathe is temporarily “paused” while the acclimation torc continues to hold a charge. You can breathe normally in vacuums, clouds of smoke, water, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres, though you aren’t protected against the damage of a corrosive atmosphere. In addition, you don’t need to worry about starvation or thirst while your acclimation torc is active. Unlike the normal protections provided by most suits of armor, an acclimation torc doesn’t grant you protection against low levels of radiation or conditions of cold and heat. An acclimation torc holds 50 charges and uses 1 charge per hour.

Sleeping Sentry	<p>The sleeping sentry is an exoskeletal harness equipped with an automated medical unit that can deliver pharmaceuticals intravenously, all mounted vertically atop a disk large enough for a Medium creature to stand on. Sleeping sentries are often used by eccentric corporations or military organizations that want round-the- clock non-automated security patrols but who don’t want to pay for multiple shifts. You activate a sleeping sentry by leaning back into the exoskeletal harness, allowing it to gently lock you into a standing position while supporting your neck, spine, legs, and arms. The automated medical unit then injects you with a cocktail of barbiturates that puts you instantly to sleep for the next 8 hours (or until awoken by the sleeping sentry); an unwilling creature forced into the harness can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to remain conscious. Shortly thereafter, antigravitry circuitry within the disc activates, suspending the entire structure approximately 1 inch off the ground and moving along a preprogrammed patrol route at a speed of 20 feet. The disc can move over land and over water, but not underwater. Creatures who come within 30 feet of an activated sleeping sentry must succeed at a DC 25 Stealth check to fool the sleeping sentry’s motion detectors, or else an integrated high-frequency proximity alarm sounds, waking you and releasing you from the harness to confront the threat.

Only physical strategy games have bulk; computer games have no bulk but generally consume 1 charge per hour of play.</p>	Tech	5	2850	2	20	1/hour	null	ARM	108
Thief Drone	<p>A thief drone is a specialized version of a basic domestic drone (Starfinder Armory 101). When activated, this Tiny drone acts as the hover drone of a 1st-level mechanic, and you control it as if you were a 1st-level mechanic (using either an included remote control or a computer with an added control), except it has the smuggler’s compartment drone mod instead of a weapons mount. The thief drone can’t make any attacks and has no feats and no ability to add drone mods beyond those specified in this entry. An activated thief drone can move its speed, but it can otherwise take only the actions specified in this description. A thief drone can understand one language (chosen at purchase), but it cannot speak. Some criminals disguise their thief drones to resemble ordinary drones, which allows these illegal models to blend in without raising suspicion. If an activated thief drone is accessible to a creature attempting an Engineering check to disable a lock, that creature reduces the DC of the Engineering check by 5. Alternatively, the thief drone can attempt to disable a lock on its own with a –5 penalty. Its skill unit is Engineering. A thief drone has a usage of 1/hour with a capacity of 20. A thief drone can be upgraded with any two of the following technological items by paying 125% of the item’s price: grappler, glass cutterAR, tool kit (hacking), or x-ray visor. The price of buying and installing an upgrade includes the price of replacing an old upgrade on a drone, if applicable.</p>	Tech	5	3000	4	null	null	null	DF03	53
Whisper Comm	<p>This tight choker with a tiny earbud operates as a comm unit’s wireless communication device with planetary range, but you can control audio connections with slight neck movements and communicate via subvocalization.

Analeptic Tablet	<p>This 2-inch-long oblong tablet contains a miniaturized scanner and 3D printer wrapped in a smooth, protective shell. An analeptic tablet must be ingested by a living creature (a standard action) or fed to an unconscious character with a full glass of water (a full action). The tablet automatically activates if the creature has already taken any ability score damage or is suffering from the effects of an affliction; otherwise it sits inactive within the creature’s stomach until the creature takes ability score damage or is affected by an affliction. One hour later, the analeptic tablet heals the target of all ability damage or moves the creature one step toward healthy on any affliction track they are on (this doesn’t cure the affliction, so unfortunate victims of fast-acting poisons might die before the analeptic tablet can do its work).<br/> When it’s activated, the analeptic tablet 3D prints cloned tissue that matches perfectly to the affected creature and repairs any damage done to the creature’s body. During this process, the creature undergoes intense pain and gains the sickened condition until the creature gets a full 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. This condition can’t be removed by any means during the hour the analeptic tablet is healing the creature but can be alleviated by magic or other means after that time. Once the analeptic tablet finishes healing the creature that swallowed it (or 1 week after it has been swallowed, whichever comes first), the item breaks down into harmless components that eventually pass out of the creature’s body.</p>	Tech	6	600	null	null	null	null	3C02	50
Blabbersponder	<p>This small, rectangular box is approximately the size of a handheld computer, with a nondescript carbon-fiber housing attached to an external chip interface that can be plugged into the computers of most starships. A blabbersponder’s case is filled with a compact array of microsensors (often composed of inubrix) connected to a miniaturized computer (treat as a tier 0 computer equipped with a control module) that, bolstered by a signal booster, analyzes and actively transmits a starship’s vital data to another source. While no astute starship captain would ever install a blabbersponder on their own ship, such devices are often sold in gray markets to saboteurs serving the whims of corporations, or bounty hunters who wish to gain vital information about a specific starship’s defenses. Some clever pirates of the Diaspora are also rumored to sell blabbersponders to gullible spacefarers by offering them as upgrades to starship communication systems. They then use the data they collect from the device to determine if the cargo, defenses, weapons, and crew aboard the ship warrant the effort of intercepting and ambushing it later. To install a blabbersponder on a starship computer, you must succeed at an Engineering check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the starship’s tier). Once installed and activated, the blabbersponder’s internal computer uses its control module to automatically hack into the computer it’s attached to. The control module reads and broadcasts all data related to the starship’s systems, allowing any science officer aboard another starship within passive sensor range (Starfinder Core Rulebook 301) of the blabbersponder’s ship to use the scan action on that vessel, even if the two ships aren’t engaged in starship combat. Because of the detailed information provided by the blabbersponder, the science officer performing this scan action gains a +5 circumstance bonus to the associated Computers check, and the broadcasting ship doesn’t add the bonus from its defensive countermeasures to the DC. Detecting that a blabbersponder is in fact an instrument of sabotage and not a benign technological device before it is installed requires a successful DC 25 Engineering or DC 30 Perception check. Discovering an installed blabbersponder aboard a starship requires a successful DC 28 Computers check. When an installed blabbersponder’s battery is depleted, it recharges itself using the starship’s power core in a process that takes about 5 minutes; on the day this occurs, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the Computers check to notice the sudden, short surge in power use and discover the blabbersponder on your vessel. Once discovered, a blabbersponder can be easily unplugged.</p>	Tech	6	4550	L	40	1/day	null	DF04	47
Comm Unit, System-Wide	<p>A personal comm unit is pocket-sized device that combines a minor portable computer (treat as a tier-0 computer with no upgrades or modules) and a cellular communication device, allowing wireless communication with other comm units in both audio- and text-based formats at planetary range (see page 272). A personal comm unit also includes a calculator, a flashlight (increases the light level one step in a 15-foot cone), and several entertainment options (including games and access to any local infospheres). You can upgrade a personal comm unit to function as some other devices (such as full computers and scanners) by spending credits equal to 110% of the additional device’s price.<br/> Comm units that function at system-wide and unlimited ranges aren’t as portable; they include built-in generators that provide the necessary amount of power. Short-term use of these units can be purchased in most major settlements (see page 234).<br/> See page 430 for more about Pact Worlds communications.</p>	Tech	6	4000	20	null	null	null	CRB	218
Dimensional Comm Unit	<p>These devices are handheld and circular in shape and have a very high-resolution screen and simple controls. Dimensional comm units are a kishalee version of the comm units commonly found in the Pact Worlds, but they function using the remnants of the vast demiplane network utilized by the now extinct kishalee civilization. The advantage of dimensional comm units is that their text and verbal communications are instantaneous, whether in the same system or through interstellar space, but because of the degraded state of the kishalee dimensional network, they work only sporadically. Prior to use, a dimensional comm unit must be linked with at least one other unit—a process that takes only a minute when all units to be linked are on the same planet. Dimensional comm units nearly always work when used on the same planet to reach other linked devices. Over greater distances, each time a dimensional comm is used, there is a 50% chance that it will function properly if used in the same system or a 25% chance if the communication is interstellar (this is rolled in secret by the GM), but only with linked dimensional comm units. If two linked dimensional comm units make a connection, they retain that connection for 24 hours. If the dimensional comm units don’t manage to connect, the users can try again after 24 hours. Dimensional comm units do not function within the Drift or on other planes.</p>	Tech	6	4500	null	null	null	1	DS05	40
Electroviscous Cloak	<p>This thin cloak is infused with conductive wiring and a polymer that changes states when charged with a specially modulated current. When you activate the cloak as a move action, its exterior becomes a frictionless gel, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against grapple combat maneuvers and to Acrobatics checks to escape from a grapple or pin. In addition, when squeezing, you do not gain the entangled condition, though you still move at half speed and can’t run or charge.</p>	Tech	6	4000	L	40	1/round	null	ARM	102
Locks, Good	<p>Locks are extremely advanced reusable devices, able to secure any fastening or closure by bonding with its surface and then holding fast. Locks usually open with a code, security chip, or voice command. Successful Engineering checks can disable locks. Locks come in four levels of quality— simple, average, good, and superior—which determine the DC of Engineering checks to open them without the proper key or code. A lock takes two hands to secure or open with a security chip. For more information on locks, including the Engineering DCs to open them, see the Engineering skill on page 141.</p>	Tech	6	3600	L	null	null	2	CRB	220

Nanite Hypopen, Black	<p>Nanite hypopens are simple-to-use, one-shot, preloaded devices roughly the size of a writing stylus that inject specialized nanites into a creature’s body to heal many sorts of mental and physical injuries. Seven types of nanite hypopens exist along a color-coded scale, as detailed below. As a standard action, you can use a nanite hypopen on yourself or an adjacent willing or unconscious living creature. Each nanite hypopen has a different effect, determined by its color; these are technological effects that function as the specific spells indicated on the chart below (using your ranks in Medicine in place of caster level when needed, such as when using a white nanite hypopen to remove a disease).

Plasma Diverter	<p>This bandolier emits a low, crackling hum when activated. Whenever an attack from a plasma weapon hits the plasma diverter’s user, half of the electricity and half the fire damage (maximum 5 points of each) is prevented and instead restores a number of charges equal to the damage prevented to the plasma diverter’s battery. If this would restore more charges than the battery can hold, the battery must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be destroyed, dealing 1d6 damage to the plasma diverter per excess charge.<br/> A plasma diverter uses a super-capacity battery, and each minute of use (or fraction thereof) consumes 10 charges.</p>	Tech	6	4300	1	80	10/minute	null	AA2	101
Smart Cable	<p>This thick industrial cable of woven plastic contains special chains of chemicals that contract, expand, and twist when they receive electronic signals. A length of smart cable has a narrow battery pack near one end. When you activate the cable, you can change its shape by sending signals from a datapad or comm unit. You can command the smart cable to coil, uncoil, tie itself around objects, or go rigid. In addition, you can cause periodic sections of the cable to crimp, allowing creatures to treat it as a knotted rope for the purposes of using Athletics to climb. Commanding a smart cable requires a move action.<br/> When inactive or out of charges, a smart cable cannot receive commands and is identical to an adamantine alloy cable line (Core Rulebook 218), except that its hardness and Hit Points are based on its level. </p>	Tech	6	4000/10 ft.

Spy Drone	<p>A spy drone is a Tiny remote drone designed specifically to make observations at a distance. This acts as the flight drone of a 1st-level mechanic (and you control it as if you were a 1st-level mechanic, using its remote control or a computer with an added module to control the spy drone), except it cannot make any attacks and it has no weapon mounts, no feats, and no ability to add drone mods. Its skill unit is always Stealth. It cannot speak, but it does understand one language (chosen by you at the time of purchase) and allows you to attempt Perception checks using your own bonus when you directly control it (as the master control ability of a mechanic drone).<br/> A drone can be upgraded with any one of the following technological items by paying 125% of the item’s price: flashlight, grappler, lantern, laser microphone, motion detector, scanner, or X-ray visor. The price of buying and installing one upgrade includes the price of replacing an old upgrade on a drone, if applicable.</p>	Tech	6	4550	L	20	1/minute	null	CRB	221
Subdermal Extractor	<p>This vicious-looking clawed wand is used to detect and quickly remove foreign objects from under the skin. You can use the subdermal extractor only on an unconscious or willing target. The clawed end of the subdermal extractor contains a delicate sensor that evaluates the target’s genetic material and scans for foreign objects (including alien eggs, biotech and cybernetic augmentations, tracking chips, etc.). To detect an anomalous object, you take a move action and must succeed at a Computers or Medicine check with a DC equal to 15 or 10 + the level of the implanted item, whichever is higher. If the implanted material was injected as part of a creature’s attack, the DC is instead 15 + the CR of the attacking creature. As a standard action, you can deploy the subdermal extractor to remove anomalous material you have detected. This typically requires a successful DC 25 Medicine check, but this DC might be lower or higher at the GM’s discretion (such as if the item is particularly small or if it has woven itself into the target’s interior physiology). Whether or not you succeed or fail at the check, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage from the attempt. Each detection attempt uses a charge from the subdermal extractor, as does each removal attempt. You can use a subdermal extractor on yourself, but the DCs of skill checks to use it are increased by 2.<br/> Although a subdermal extractor can be used to quickly remove cybernetics or other augmentations, only the most disreputable back-alley shops use subdermal extractors for this purpose, and such augmentations still can’t be resold. </p>	Tech	6	3850	1	20	1/use	1	ARM	108
Tracking Bug	<p>This tiny tracking device contains a miniaturized transponder that makes it easier to follow and locate quarry. Tracking bugs are usually sold on Absalom Station to private detective agencies and suspicious family members. You can hide a tracking bug on a creature as a standard action with a successful Sleight of Hand check to pick the creature’s pocket (this usually can’t be done during combat). You can hide a tracking bug on a vehicle or other conveyance as a standard action with a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the Perception checks of anyone searching the vehicle; you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to this check due to the tracking bug’s size.<br/> Once you plant a tracking bug, you can use a custom program (included in the tracking bug’s price) to follow the tracking bug with a successful DC 20 Computers check using a computer, a comm unit, a mechanic’s custom rig, or any similar computing device; the GM can alter this DC to reflect environmental conditions and other factors. The tracking bug’s transponder has a 500-foot-radius range, and you must be on the same plane as the tracking bug for the program to function. When a tracking bug runs out of power, you can no longer follow it.</p>	Tech	6	4250	L	20	1/hour	null	PWD	199
Antigravity Belt	<p>Most commonly used by those brave enough to travel to the high-gravity world of Aucturn, this belt uses a form of graviton levitation to essentially reduce gravitational pull. You can activate the belt as a swift action, and it operates until you spend another swift action to deactivate it or until it runs out of charges. You treat areas of extreme gravity as having high gravity, areas of high gravity as having standard gravity, and areas of standard gravity as having low gravity.

Horizon Shield	<p>A horizon shield slips over one hand much like a set of brass knuckles with a touch-sensitive control pad resting in your palm. Activating or deactivating a horizon shield is a move action. When activated, a horizon shield forms a nearly invisible barrier that warps space around you, making you more difficult to hit with ranged attacks. Any ranged attack targeting you treats you as if are 60 feet farther away than you actually are. This might impart a range increment penalty to the attack roll or even make the attack impossible altogether. You must be aware of the attacker and can’t be holding anything else in the hand equipped with the horizon shield. This effect doesn’t stack with effects from other horizon shields. A horizon shield has a capacity of 20 and uses 1 charge per round that it is active.</p>	Tech	7	6500	1	20	1/round	1	DS05	40

Organic Printing Vat	<p>This container made of transparent glass is about the size of a backpack (and can be worn like one, though it can’t store any items). An organic printing vat allows you to craft technological devices (including weapons and armor) and computers out of biological matter. You still need to have the requisite number of ranks in Computers or Engineering and an amount of UPBs equal to the price of the item to be created, and the process takes the same amount of time, but the organic printing vat counts as the necessary tools and workshop space. You can craft only items of 2 bulk or less, but any item you craft gains the analog and living weapon special properties and isn’t considered a manufactured item (and is therefore immune to spells such as entropic grasp). If an item created with an organic printing vat is destroyed, it dissolves into a biological sludge that counts as a number of UPBs equal to 15% of the item’s value that can be used to create another item with the organic printing vat.<br/> An organic printing vat uses a high-capacity battery and consumes 1 charge per hour of use.</p>	Tech	7	5400	3	40	1/use	null	A!02	44

Traction Holster	<p>This flat, metal plate usually appears to be a simple rectangle about 1 foot long with a textile belt or armband firmly attached to one side. As a full action, you can activate a traction holster by pressing a longarm, one-handed melee weapon, small arm, or piece of equipment of no more than 1 bulk flat against it, creating a quasi-magnetic bond with the weapon. Only one weapon at a time can be paired in this way. Thereafter, when you drop the weapon or it would otherwise land adjacent to you, it is automatically drawn into the traction holster as though you had spent a move action to sheathe or holster it. The holster does not protect a paired weapon against disarm combat maneuvers. A traction holster operates until it runs out of charges or until you take a full action to break the connection between the traction holster and its current weapon by holding down a small reset button. </p>	Tech	7	6000	L	80	10/minute	null	ARM	109

Envoy’S Mouthpiece	<p>Popularized by successful lashunta diplomats, an envoy’s mouthpiece is an elegant circlet with slender arms that reach down along the jaw. Two thin earpieces extend from the band to slip unobtrusively into your ears once the mouthpiece is donned. When created, an envoy’s mouthpiece is encoded with one specific language. Whenever the language is spoken within 30 feet of you, the mouthpiece translates that language into Common. In addition, any words you speak in Common are transformed by the mouthpiece into the encoded language, allowing conversation to take place between you and speakers of the encoded language. An envoy’s mouthpiece cannot be used to translate languages other than the one it has been programmed to translate, although devices that translate into languages other than Common do exist. An envoy’s mouthpiece automatically records any words it translates, allowing anything translated through the device to be replayed through its earpiece at the touch of a button located on the lower right side. Up to 10 continuous hours can be recorded in this manner. Holding the button down for a full round erases any currently stored conversations.</p>	Tech	8	9000	L	20	2/hour	null	ARM	103
Flushbuster	<p>A flushbuster is a palm-sized, malleable, one-use satchel charge designed specifically to travel easily through any water-propagated waste-removal system (such as those found on many planets with standard gravity and aboard some starships). It resembles a vacuum-sealed plastic bag divided into two pouches, one containing a substance that looks like purple clay, and the other containing a substance that resembles green gelatin. The bag itself is made of a time-release polymer that instantaneously disintegrates after 1d4 minutes of immersion in water, allowing the two volatile substances within to mix into a composite explosive that immediately detonates. Once the bag disintegrates, the mixture of the composite explosive and water generates a massive pressurized explosion that overloads the pipe system, causing any toilet or latrine within 100 feet of the device and connected to it by pipe to explode violently. Each creature or object within a 10-foot radius of any exploding toilet takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 12 half) and watery sewage begins flooding into the room (filling a 15-foot-by-15-foot room with 1 foot of water per round). A creature that begins its turn within this sewage must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or gain the sickened condition for 1 minute.

Warning Wire, Mk 2	<p>This 50 feet of thin, nearly invisible wire is spooled around a dull-gray, flat metal cylinder. When any amount of the wire is unspooled and the cylinder is activated, the wire becomes exceptionally sensitive to vibration. The wire is often wrapped around valuable belongings or stretched as a trip wire across a doorway. When the activated wire is moved or touched, the cylinder emits a piercing alarm (though you can set it to send a silent alarm wirelessly to a comm unit or datapad instead). Noticing the warning wire requires a successful Perception check with a DC equal to 20 + the level of the warning wire, and bypassing it without setting it off usually requires a successful Acrobatics check at the same DC, though the GM might adjust the DC higher or lower as circumstances dictate. You can twist the cylinder in a preset pattern as a move action, deactivating the alarm and respooling the wire around the cylinder. <table> <tr><th>MODEL</th><th>LEVEL</th><th>DC TO NOTICE</th></tr> <tr><td>Mk 1</td><td>4</td><td>24</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 2</td><td>8</td><td>28</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 3</td><td>12</td><td>32</td></tr> <tr><td>Mk 4</td><td>16</td><td>36</td></tr> </table></p>	Tech	8	8800	L	40	1/hour	null	ARM	109
Autocartographer	<p>This handheld holographic display unit has an underslung rack housing dozens of miniaturized flying microbots. When you activate the autocartographer, you pick a grid intersection within 50 feet to which you have line of effect. The microbots scatter in a 100-foot cube, scanning the environment and sending data back to the display unit for aggregation and analysis. The microbots transmit the dimensions and basic layout of rooms, corridors, and sizable natural features, including large furnishings. Their sensors ignore living creatures, fine details (such as images on computer screens), and temporary magical effects, but they record permanent ones, including illusory obstacles. They can’t differentiate between illusions or holograms and real objects. The microbots’ data is sent by a wireless signal and is therefore vulnerable to countermeasures such as signal jammers.<br/> Individual microbots are small enough to pass through any opening at least an inch wide. They can operate both in air or vacuum, but heavy gravity or strong or stronger winds overwhelm their delicate propulsion systems and render them inactive. The microbots emit a distinctive whir and can be detected with a successful DC 15 Perception check.<br/> One minute after you release the microbots, the autocartographer displays a composite map showing all features within the scanned 100-foot cube as a three-dimensional holographic image, and the microbots return to the unit. You can save these images in a data file that can be displayed later, although you need to rescan an area to obtain updated information, such as opened doors or repositioned furniture. Each file is tagged with global or astronomical positioning data, allowing you to connect multiple maps in space and scroll between them. </p>	Tech	9	13500	1	100	10/hour	1	ARM	98

Dna Scrambler	<p>This small gun-shaped device uses acute microwave radiation to scramble the DNA of living creatures caught in its area of effect. It was accidentally invented by shirren scientists attempting to understand Swarm biology and turned into an effective nonlethal, albeit pain-inducing, weapon. While wielding a DNA scrambler in one-hand, you can activate it as a standard action, dealing 3d8 nonlethal damage to all living targets in a 30-foot cone as their DNA unravels. This causes a great deal of pain, imparting the off-target condition on each living creature in the cone for 1 round. A creature who DC 19 Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and negates the off-target condition. This is a pain effect.</p>	Tech	10	17400	L	null	null	null	A!02	44
Domestic Drone, Elite Deckhand	<p>This Small drone is designed to provide basic assistance aboard a starship or other large vessel, including supplemental computation for navigation or astrogation. Most deckhand drones resemble a squat box with stubby, clawed feet that allow it to keep its orientation in zero-g. A deckhand drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the climbing claws and tool arm (fire extinguisher) mods instead of the stealth drone’s normal initial mods. If an activated deckhand drone is accessible to a creature attempting a Piloting check to navigate, that creature reduces the time needed to plot a course by half (generally from 10 minutes to 5 minutes).

Inductive Bandolier	<p>This heavy bandolier’s large, flat buckle is a metallic charging pad that charges synced devices that are within a few inches of your body, including light or heavy armor or armor upgrades installed in light or heavy armor. While the bandolier is activated, you can tap a rechargeable item to the pad to sync the item to the bandolier (the item must use charges or a battery; the inductive bandolier can’t recharge other items). The synced item regains 1 charge per minute until it is fully charged or until the synced item is more than a few inches from your body. In either case, the item is no longer synced and the bandolier vibrates slightly to alert you to the lost connection.

Bypass Subroutine	<p>A bypass subroutine is a miniaturized single-function computer which takes the form of a ring with four nanite circuit-nodes and can be sized to fit nearly any finger. The compact nanites are attuned to input from the circuit-nodes and can form specific tools much larger than the ring itself as directed by information stored within the circuit-node. Infiltrators utilize these high-tech metal bands to assist in covert missions. Aspis Consortium agents also use these rings to ensure that locks that were opened appear as if they were never tampered with.<br/> When you succeed at a Computers or Engineering check to open a lock, you can activate the ring as a reaction. The ring then stores a record of the processes and tools used in opening the lock, and one of the nanite circuit-nodes on the ring takes on a texture or color associated with the area around the lock. As a move action, you can touch the ring to a lock recorded therein and it recreates the conditions needed to change the lock's status (creating any required tool output with nanites), either opening or relocking that lock.<br/> A bypass subroutine can record one lock in each of its circuitnodes. Any additional recordings must replace one of the four already in the ring.</p>	Tech	11	23000	null	null	null	null	ARM	98

Comm Unit, Unlimited	<p>A personal comm unit is pocket-sized device that combines a minor portable computer (treat as a tier-0 computer with no upgrades or modules) and a cellular communication device, allowing wireless communication with other comm units in both audio- and text-based formats at planetary range (see page 272). A personal comm unit also includes a calculator, a flashlight (increases the light level one step in a 15-foot cone), and several entertainment options (including games and access to any local infospheres). You can upgrade a personal comm unit to function as some other devices (such as full computers and scanners) by spending credits equal to 110% of the additional device’s price.<br/> Comm units that function at system-wide and unlimited ranges aren’t as portable; they include built-in generators that provide the necessary amount of power. Short-term use of these units can be purchased in most major settlements (see page 234).<br/> See page 430 for more about Pact Worlds communications.</p>	Tech	12	32000	40	null	null	null	CRB	218

Flash Shield Generator	<p>This scepter-like device coalesces atmosphere into a crystalline sheet. When you activate a flash shield generator, you select one edge of a square within 10 feet of you and create a 5-foot-square vertical sheet of translucent crystal on that edge, providing partial cover against attacks coming from one side of the sheet (your choice). The flash shield must be supported by the ground or another structure when it is created, and it can’t support any weight. You can make the flash shield cloudy when you create it, which causes it to block line of sight. The flash shield is delicate and easy to break; it has an AC of 10, hardness 0, and 10 Hit Points. A flash shield disintegrates on its own after 24 hours. If you create a new flash shield within 100 feet of an existing shield, the old shield disappears, its material evaporated and transformed to create the new shield.

Neuropoppet	<p>A neuropoppet is a small simulacrum of a featureless humanoid creature, composed of a malleable eggshell-white polymer that is wirelessly linked to a tiny needle-shaped neural receiver. The receiver can be loaded into any ranged weapon that uses darts as ammunition, though it deals no damage to a target when fired (nor can it impose any critical hit effects). Instead, the receiver embeds into the target’s body, injecting a small numbing agent into the target’s bloodstream, making them unaware of the embedded receiver unless they or an adjacent ally succeeds at a Perception check (DC = the result of your attack roll to embed the receiver). Once found, the receiver can be removed with a standard action and a successful DC 30 Medicine check. The signal sent from a neuropoppet to the neural receiver can be jammed with a signal jammer. While the neural receiver is embedded in a living humanoid target within 60 feet, you can manipulate the neuropoppet as a full action with two hands (this uses up one of the item’s charges), causing the receiver to send subtle electrical signals through the target’s nervous system.

While connected in this way, both wearers gain a +2 insight bonus to initiative and Perception checks. If one wearer is aware of a combatant, the other wearer is also aware of it, and a wearer cannot be surprised unless the other wearer is also surprised. If one wearer succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve an illusion effect, the other wearer also disbelieves that effect.

Regeneration Table	<p>A regeneration table is a medical bed that uses the most advanced medical technology known in the Pact Worlds to restore a creature’s body to full function from nearly any mishap or injury, including death. It does this with quantum-locked nanites held in a suspended state from which they can become nearly any form of matter, including stem cells for biological creatures or mechanical components for artificial creatures like androids or Akiton’s anacites. The table both reads the creature’s own genetic code (or equivalent data) and uses supercomputing predictive algorithms to determine what damage or affliction is present, then attempts to restore the subject to perfect health based on that information.<br/> A living creature using a regeneration table is affected as if a 6th-level mystic cure spell as well as the remove affliction and restoration spells were cast on it. A dead creature is affected as if raise dead were cast on it.

If an affected grenade’s level is at least 5 levels lower than the grenade scrambler’s, it automatically misses. </p>	Tech	20	815000	1	100	5/round	null	ARM	103
Disintegration Hoop	<p>This adamantine ring is 1 foot in diameter and surrounded by coils and circuitry. When activated, the disintegration hoop completely obliterates all matter placed through the center. Creatures that place an appendage into the hoop take 4d20 electricity and fire damage as the appendage is disintegrated, and creatures small enough to fit entirely within the hoop instead take 14d20 electricity and fire damage. In either case, a creature that would be forced through the hoop can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to avoid passing into the hoop. Appendages destroyed by the disintegration hoop can be restored only with regenerate or a similarly powerful effect; creatures slain by the hoop can be restored only with miracle or wish. Attempts at creating larger disintegration hoops have thus far been disastrous failures, although rumors persist of larger, stable disintegration hoops that use advanced technology.</p>	Tech	20	750000	1	100	10/round	null	ARM	101
Grenade Scrambler, Mk 6	<p>When activated as a move action, this unit emits a wireless signal that interferes with the detonation sequence of grenades within 30 feet. Grenades that would successfully land at an intersection in the area have a 50% chance to miss, and any grenade that targets an intersection in the area and misses lands 1d6 squares away (instead of 1d4). A grenade scrambler affects only grenades whose item level is equal to or lower than its own level. If an affected grenade’s level is at least 5 levels lower than the grenade scrambler’s, it automatically misses. </p>	Tech	20	815000	1	100	5/round	null	ARM	103
