2	Cargo Lifter	<p>A cargo lifter consists of a simple metal frame atop slow-moving legs or treads. Rather than having articulated hands, its arms end in specialized gripping tools meant to lift bulky containers. A cargo lifter can’t use weapons and takes a –4 penalty to all attack rolls. It can carry 10 bulk more than normal for its Strength score without becoming encumbered or overburdened.</p>	4	2150	0	7	0	10	15 feet	15	null	null	null	null	20	1d10 B	1	10	B	Large	5	40	1/minute	60	0	0	34	CRB	204
3	Scrapper's Rig	<p>Most often constructed by desperate scavengers or goblins, a scrapper’s rig is a mismatched, ungainly amalgamation of exposed wires, steel plates, and leaky hydraulics. You cannot run or charge when wearing a scrapper’s rig.</p>	4	2150	5	9	2	6	20 feet	20	null	null	null	null	16	1d8 B	1	8	B	Medium	0	20	1/hour	1	3	1	22	ARM	78
4	Absorptive Shell	<p>This powered armor consists of a thin frame around a central command unit (which fits around the torso for a typical wearer), covered in form-fitting plates filled with a rheopectic fluid that hardens when struck, dispersing force throughout the armor and absorbing crushing blows. Although an absorptive shell provides significant protection, the fluid-filled plates can’t support a weapon mount.<br/> Unlike many forms of powered armor which are primarily used as military combat gear, absorptive shells are also often used as safety equipment for skilled rescue workers operating in extremely hazardous conditions, ranging from areas prone to rockfalls, starship crashes, and vehicles that still have explosives and industrial chemicals leaking from them, to actual war zones where rescue workers may come under fire.</p>	5	3375	7	12	3	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	18	1d10 B	1	10	B	Medium	0	20	1/hour	1	0	1	18	ARM	74

6	Spacer Carapace	<p>This powered armor resembles a bulky humanoid insect, including helmet-mounted oxygen canisters that appear as stylized mandibles. The armor’s wide boots contain powerful magnets useful for navigating the exterior of starships and space stations for repair work or guard duty. You can move your land speed across metal surfaces in zero gravity without having to attempt checks; if you are adjacent to a metal surface, you do not automatically move at the beginning of your turn each round. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers when you are standing on a metal surface.</p>	6	4650	8	13	2	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	18	1d10 B	1	10	B	Medium	0	20	1/hour	1	1	2	20	ARM	78
7	Laborer Frame	<p>A laborer frame resembles an anacite laborer (Starfinder Alien Archive 10). These armor frames allow weapon and upgrade modifications, mimicking the ways in which anacite laborers improve themselves. The frame is also reconfigurable for movement. When you buy the armor, the movement is set to one mode that you choose, but this mode can be changed with 1 hour of work using an engineering toolkit or tech workshop. The possible modes are detailed below.<br/> <strong>Advanced Treads:</strong> The land speed the armor grants you increases to 40 feet.<br/> <strong>Climbing Pads:</strong> The armor grants you a climb speed of 15 feet.<br/> <strong>Swim Jets:</strong> The armor grants you a swim speed of 15 feet.</p>	7	7500	10	13	2	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	18	1d10 B	1	10	B	Medium	0	40	1/hour	1	2	2	22	AA2	11
8	Personal Submersible	<p>This bulky, bulbous armor is made of pressure-resistant plates with durable seals. Retractable ridges along the armor’s arms, legs, and back function as fins, providing increased mobility in most fluids. The armor grants you a swim speed and allows you to both breathe underwater and survive the pressure of thick atmospheres and great depths even when your environmental protections are not active.</p>	7	7200	10	14	2	4	20 feet, swim 30 feet	20	30	null	null	null	18	1d10 P	1	10	P	Large	5	40	1/hour	1	1	2	32	ARM	78
9	Spellcaster's Aegis	<p>A reinforced frame with sunburst patterns that shift and spin, this armor projects holographic runes in the air around you as you move. If you have at least 5 ranks in Mysticism and the ability to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, you can use these runes defensively, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities and a +2 enhancement bonus to dispel checks (such as when you cast dispel magic).</p>	8	10250	12	16	3	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	19	1d10 B	1	10	B	Large	5	40	1/hour	1	1	2	35	ARM	79
10	Brawler Frame	<p>Designed for brutal gladiatorial matches against other fighters in powered armor, a brawler frame consists of nanotech shock absorbers sandwiched between rigid metal plates. The default frame comes with blunt piston-powered fists designed to deal bludgeoning damage, but customized models with heavy blades or picks (dealing slashing or piercing damage, respectively) are not uncommon. Many owners paint their brawler frames with garish colors to be more distinctive in the arena.</p>	9	14500	12	18	3	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	20	3d6 B	3	6	B	Large	10	40	1/minute	60	3	2	38	ARM	75
11	Ironclad Bulwark	<p>This heavy suit of reinforced metal and polymer powered armor provides superior protection at the expense of mobility. It can mount melee weapons in its weapon slots, rather than only ranged weapons.</p>	10	19250	16	19	2	6	20 feet	20	null	null	null	null	20	1d10 B	1	10	B	Large	5	100	4/hour	4	2	3	32	ARM	78
12	Spider Harness	<p>This suspension harness has six arachnid legs. Each leg has a gravitic attraction device at the tip, allowing the armor to climb up walls and even walk across ceilings. The armor grants the wearer a climb speed of 25 feet. A spider harness also has powered arm braces that attach to the wearer’s arms, allowing the wearer to use weapons.</p>	10	19500	10	13	5	4	25 feet, climb 25 feet	25	null	25	null	null	18	1d10 P	1	10	P	Large	10	40	1/minute	60	1	2	28	CRB	204

14	Stag-Step Suit	<p>Forged and constructed from supernatural metals collected from the realms of the fey, this powered armor has long antlers atop its blank-faced helmet. If the armor has at least 10 charges remaining, you can spend 10 charges to create a fold in reality, per the dimension door spell. You can travel only 100 feet with this ability, and you can’t take other creatures with you. Once you have used this ability, the stag-step suit retains a charge of dimensional static that prevents you from using the armor’s ability again for 24 hours.</p>	11	26400	16	18	4	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	20	2d6 P	2	6	P	Large	10	40	1/hour	1	3	3	30	ARM	79
15	Celerity Rigging	<p>Unlike most other suits of powered armor, which are cumbersome and slow, this armor was designed for magically amplified responsiveness and speed. The armor resembles a humanoid frame of narrow rods, providing you with superior visibility and maneuverability while worn. Instead of heavy plating to absorb blows, celerity rigging uses sophisticated planes of magical force to deflect attacks. Incorporeal creatures’ attacks target your KAC rather than your EAC when you are wearing this armor.</p>	12	38500	16	20	5	2	50 feet	50	null	null	null	null	22	2d6 B	2	6	B	Medium	0	40	1/hour	1	2	2	4	ARM	75
16	White Walker	<p>The thick legs of this heavily insulated armor end in short retractable spikes, allowing you to easily anchor yourself to most surfaces. You gain a +2 bonus to your AC when resisting bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers as long as you are standing on the ground. You and the armor are immune to cold damage and cold environments, even when your environmental protections are not active. Your movement is not slowed by icy surfaces, and the DCs of Acrobatics checks you attempt on such surfaces do not increase.</p>	13	52100	16	22	4	4	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	26	2d6 P	2	6	P	Large	10	20	1/hour	1	2	3	34	ARM	79
17	Explorer's Cradle	<p>Travelers on alien worlds must be prepared to confront a variety of difficult environments. This long-range powered armor resembles a humanoid torso atop several bristly metal tendrils ending in sharp, grasping claws. The armor has comfortable seating and a supply of nutritious paste delivered intravenously; while wearing an explorer’s cradle, you do not need to eat or drink. As a standard action, you can extend and reshape the tentacles into a variety of forms resembling limbs, fins, or wings, gaining one of the following abilities until you next rearrange the tentacles.<br/> <strong>Bladed Strikes:</strong> The damage dealt by this armor increases to 4d8 slashing damage.<br/> <strong>Climbing Claws:</strong> You gain a climb speed of 20 feet.<br/> <strong>Creeping Legs:</strong> Your movement is not slowed by difficult terrain, although you still cannot run or charge through difficult terrain.<br/> <strong>Fluttering Wings:</strong> The tentacles splay out behind you and form connective membranes to create wings, granting you a fly speed of 20 feet with clumsy maneuverability.<br/> <strong>Undulating Tendrils:</strong> You gain a swim speed of 20 feet.</p>	14	79000	17	23	3	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	23	3d6 B	3	6	B	Large	10	100	1/hour	1	2	2	35	ARM	75
18	Commander's Harness	<p>A reinforced version of the standard battle harness (Core Rulebook 204), this powered armor frame is most often used by squad leaders commanding units of heavily armored soldiers. Its larger size helps leaders of entire armored battalions maintain visibility and control during a confrontation.</p>	15	122500	19	24	3	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	28	2d8 B	2	8	B	Large	10	40	1/hour	1	3	2	40	ARM	75
19	Jarlslayer	<p>The dwarven-built jarlslayer suit is traditionally shaped like a stocky, heavily armored dwarf with articulated hands, though other races have created sleeker, more modern-looking versions.</p>	15	125500	18	24	4	6	20 feet	20	null	null	null	null	29	2d8 B	2	8	B	Large	10	100	1/minute	60	2	2	43	CRB	204
20	Angel Frame	<p>This surprisingly light suit of hybrid powered armor uses technomagical microthrusters to grant you flight and incredible mobility. In its undeployed form, an angel frame looks and functions as a specific kind of clothing LEVEL 16 (Starfinder Core Rulebook 230), often an environmental outfit or travel outfit. In this form, an angel frame grants none of the effects of wearing powered armor and doesn’t use charges. As a full action, you can speak a command word that causes pieces of the armor to deploy from extra-dimensional spaces and fit together around you. Once deployed, the angel frame functions as powered armor with the listed statistics. You can return the angel frame to its undeployed form as a full action by speaking the same command word. An angel frame that runs out of power stays in its deployed form and has a bulk of 18; you can still exit the armor as a full action.<br/> Angel frames tend to resemble a gleaming suit of full plate perfectly tailored to your form, sometimes with wing-like protrusions at its shoulders; its appearance can also be subtly altered to fit your personal aesthetic.</p>	16	191000	18	22	6	2	30 ft.; fly 60 ft.

21	Kyton Bloodsuit	<p>This union of chains, metal plates, and magically solidified blood has a brutally functional appearance. Designed in cooperation with the pain-loving kytons of the Shadow Plane, kyton bloodsuits include clusters of blades and needles on the inside of the armor that shift about, seeking to pierce the wearer’s skin. The armor deals 1d4 damage to you each minute of operation (whenever the armor uses a charge). When you take this damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to restore 5 charges to the kyton bloodsuit, but you can’t restore more charges than it actually holds.</p>	16	187750	20	25	4	2	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	27	3d6 P	3	6	P	Large	10	100	1/minute	60	2	3	30	ARM	78
22	Extradimensional Armor	<p>Constructed with the aid of mad cultists who revere inhuman, unknowable entities from the most distant corners of reality, this metallic armor defies conventional geometry. Its flat planes appear strangely curved upon close inspection, and its contours bend and blur. Your opponents can’t keep a clear sight on the armor’s shape or position, even when looking directly at it. If you have concealment from an attacker from any source, increase the miss chance from concealment by 10% (normally to 30%). If you do not have concealment from an attacker, the armor’s warped shape grants you concealment but with only a 10% miss chance. This armor has no effect on attacks against you when you have total concealment. Wearing the armor has a deleterious effect on mortal sanity; when you remove the armor, you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 plus 1 per full hour spent wearing the extradimensional armor) or take a –2 penalty to Will saves and Wisdom-based ability checks and skill checks for 24 hours.</p>	17	278200	22	28	3	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	26	2d10 P	2	10	P	Medium	10	20	1/hour	1	3	3	20	ARM	75
23	Reactor Guard	<p>This heavy, awkward armor is built with the highest levels of radiation shielding and anti-radiation materials known in the Pact Worlds. Primarily used to lift ultra-dense materials within reactor cores, reactor guard armor is useful for anyone fighting or working in areas with toxic levels of radiation. You and the armor are both immune to radiation (Core Rulebook 403) even when your environmental protections are not active, and you can’t contract radiation sickness while wearing the armor.</p>	17	271000	24	27	4	4	25 feet	25	null	null	null	null	30	4d6 B	4	6	B	Large	5	40	1/minute	60	3	4	35	ARM	78
24	Surnoch Suit	<p>This sturdy gray suit of powered armor has rows of fine blades running along the body and limbs, which serve as digging claws; it is often used by elite sapper teams to reach entrenched enemies. A surnoch suit grants you a burrow speed. You can tunnel through rock while wearing a surnoch suit, but your speed is reduced to 5 feet.</p>	18	405000	23	27	3	4	30 feet, burrow 20 feet	30	null	null	null	20	29	3d10 S	3	10	S	Large	10	20	1/hour	1	4	3	35	ARM	79
25	Warmaster's Harness	<p>The most sophisticated and powerful version of the common powered battle harness, the warmaster’s harness resembles a towering, armored titan. Its wide shoulder frame normally mounts short-range communication equipment to orchestrate troop movements or an enormous banner to identify military affiliation. It is often used by the generals of entire armies (or by assistants to such generals, in cases where the general cannot be risked directly on the front lines).</p>	19	610000	24	28	3	5	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	31	5d10 S	5	10	S	Gargantuan	20	20	1/hour	1	5	4	110	ARM	79
26	Starguard	<p>This shimmering golden armor is made primarily of reinforced esaris, a extremely light and durable proprietary material developed by the kasathan doyenate. One of the most expensive and well-designed armors produced by kasathans, starguard deflects energy attacks nearly as effectively as its reinforced frame absorbs physical blows. The interior of the helmet provides continuous status updates about your surroundings, providing you blindsight (vibration) with a range of 120 feet.</p>	20	904500	27	29	4	3	30 feet	30	null	null	null	null	30	4d8 B	4	8	B	Medium	10	40	1/hour	1	4	5	10	ARM	79
