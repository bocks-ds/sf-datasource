Apocalypse crystal, shard	<p>Regions ravaged by a living apocalypse’s radioactivity sometimes develop a form of natural solarian weapon crystal known as an apocalypse crystal. While no one is foolish enough to oppose a living apocalypse to search its environs for these crystals, when a living apocalypse moves away from a devastated area it dwelt in for a long period, there is often a “crystal rush.” Representatives of solarian academies and other prospectors in environmental suits risk exposure to lingering radiation in hopes of finding any apocalypse crystals before anyone else—and before the malevolent nuclear ooze returns.<br/> An apocalypse crystal causes the damage dealt by your solarian weapon to function as a force effect. On a critical hit, your target’s molecules begin to lose cohesion, inflicting terrible damage.</p>	1	150	+1	Corrode 1d4	null	null	AA2	81
Electron crystal, shard	<p>While in use, an electron crystal causes a solar weapon to crackle with electricity and dance with magnetic distortions. The user can control these distortions to dull a blow to the target, which many solarians consider to be a useful feature for incapacitating foes. An electron crystal polarizes the energy of a solar weapon, adding electricity damage and allowing you to convert all damage dealt to nonlethal. These crystals are available in shard, least, minor, lesser, standard, greater, and true versions.</p>	1	280	+1 E	null	null	Stun	ARM	49
Photino crystal, shard	<p>In their travels, solar wisps sometimes shed portions of themselves, which cool rapidly into a glittering stream of beautiful bright-orange jewels called photino crystals that are used throughout the Pact Worlds (and beyond) as naturally occurring solarian weapon crystals. A few small starship crews make a dangerous living by following wisps— at a great distance—and waiting for this molting, scooping up the resulting jewels until their cargo holds are full, and then returning to a safer location to sort them by quality. Despite the danger inherent in collecting the gems, these solarian weapon crystals are widely available, especially in the sun’s Burning Archipelago in the Pact Worlds; aboard the kasathan worldship the Idari; and in Fullbright, Verces’s scorched, sun-facing hemisphere.</p>	1	110	+1 F	null	null	null	AA2	117

Apocalypse crystal, true	<p>Regions ravaged by a living apocalypse’s radioactivity sometimes develop a form of natural solarian weapon crystal known as an apocalypse crystal. While no one is foolish enough to oppose a living apocalypse to search its environs for these crystals, when a living apocalypse moves away from a devastated area it dwelt in for a long period, there is often a “crystal rush.” Representatives of solarian academies and other prospectors in environmental suits risk exposure to lingering radiation in hopes of finding any apocalypse crystals before anyone else—and before the malevolent nuclear ooze returns.<br/> An apocalypse crystal causes the damage dealt by your solarian weapon to function as a force effect. On a critical hit, your target’s molecules begin to lose cohesion, inflicting terrible damage.</p>	20	776000	+6d6	Corrode 5d6	null	null	AA2	81

Graviton crystal, true	<p>Graviton crystals accelerate the impact of a weapon, dealing extra damage and potentially knocking down targets.</p>	20	727100	+6d6	Knockdown	null	null	CRB	186
Muon crystal, greater	<p>Theoretically kin to the electron crystal, a muon crystal turns its user’s solar weapon into a wispy glow in shimmering colors, closer to the auroras certain worlds experience than the unadulterated light of a star. This diffuse weapon slides easily through most matter, making it easier to tear through living creatures and inanimate objects alike. Muon crystals are available in least, minor, lesser, standard, and greater varieties.</p>	20	760000	+10d4	null	null	Penetrating	ARM	49
Photon crystal, true	<p>Photon crystals add compressed photonic energy to a weapon strike, adding fire damage and the potential to burn the target.</p>	20	729500	+6d6 F	Burn 5d6	null	null	CRB	186
T-quark crystal, true	<p>T-quark crystals have a rapid rate of decay that a solarian can manipulate a limited number of times per day to charge his solar weapon for a more powerful strike. When the t-quark crystal is active, the solar weapon is surrounded by a chaotic storm of particles, the spiraling results of the crystal’s decay. T-quark crystals are available in least, minor, lesser, standard, greater, and true varieties.</p>	20	750000	+6d6	null	null	Variant boost 6d6 (5/day)	ARM	49
