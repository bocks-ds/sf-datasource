1	Acid Rain	<p>A storm deals 3d6 damage for 1 round per level, imposes a 50% miss chance, and staggers enemies at its end.</p><p>You pull a downpour of elemental precipitation from an alternate reality. You then direct this acid rain to pour only onto your enemies, dealing them 3d6 acid damage each round. The acid splashes into and burns your foes&rsquo; eyes, coats them in slime, and clouds their other senses. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save when exposed to the spell. On a failure, the creature has a 50% miss chance for its attacks while in the area. The rain causes spellcasters who fail the save to have a 20% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast from within the area. When this spell ends, a thunderclap causes enemies still in the area who failed their Fortitude saves to be staggered for 1 round.<br />As a standard action, you can change the rain, causing it to deal a different type of energy damage, such as fiery sparks that deal fire damage or shards of ice that deal cold damage. This change in damage types leaves secondary effects unchanged. When the spell ends, the rain leaves no aftereffects.</p>	null	null	5	evocation	1 standard action	null	cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)	5	null	1 round/level (D)	Fortitude partial (see text)	no	COM	133

Your tier 0 or better computer (such as a comm unit) instantly compiles snippets and selections from various media relevant to the subject. The information remains for 2 minutes, during which you explore it. Once you&rsquo;re finished, you can attempt one skill check to recall knowledge on the topic with a +4 divine bonus, and you can do so untrained if the DC is 20 or lower. On a failed skill check, the GM can select some small insight into the topic that you retain. All the information you downloaded from this spell then disappears back to the Akashic Record. Using this spell doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from doing further research using a downloaded data set or library chip, but perusing this magical download can&rsquo;t be done concurrently with such study.</p>	1	1	1	divination	1 round	null	null	1	null	2 minutes (see text)	null	null	A!05	50
4	Akashic Revival	<p>You create perfect documentation of your physical body in the Akashic Record at the time the spell is cast, allowing you to later recall this record and reconstruct your body as it was when you cast this spell.</p><p>You create perfect documentation of your physical body in the Akashic Record at the time the spell is cast, allowing you to later recall this record and reconstruct your body as it was when you cast this spell. The record of your body includes your current Stamina Points, Hit Points, augmentations, physical ability scores, and any enduring negative physical states (including ability damage or drain to physical ability scores, disease, negative levels, poison, and so on). Any effect that was affecting you when you cast this spell to store your record continues with its normal duration, so that effect might expire between the time you store your record and when you later recall it.</p><p>To recall your record, either you must die due to events other than old age or, if you are at 0 Hit Points, you can instead allow your body to perish by spending 3 Resolve Points. If either of these things occurs, you can claim your record as your new physical body at the start of your next turn. Your corpse disappears. Then, you instantly reappear, standing in your recorded body in the corpse&rsquo;s space and wearing your gear. If you cannot appear in that space, you appear as close to it as you can. You retain your mind as it was at the time of your body&rsquo;s death, so you regain no expended spells, Resolve Points, or uses of special abilities. Any mental effects affecting you or mental ability damage present at the time of your death persist in your new body.</p><p>Casting this spell again replaces any previous record of yourself with a new one&mdash;you can store only one copy of yourself in the Akashic Record.</p>	6	null	6	necromancy	1 hour	null	null	1	null	24 hours	null	null	A!05	50
5	Alter Corpse	<p>You cause a corpse to change to suit a narrative you choose.</p><p>You cause a corpse to change to suit a narrative you choose. This spell can hide or create clues about how the corpse ended up in its current state, from closing wounds to evaporating chemicals in the cadaver&rsquo;s system. However, the changes cannot be major, such as removing or restoring a limb, or stripping flesh from the skeleton. The spell is also unable to change the corpse&rsquo;s identity.<br />Anyone who examines the corpse can attempt a Perception check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to notice that the corpse&rsquo;s condition (or lack thereof) seems manipulated, but success doesn&rsquo;t allow the observer to determine what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast. Closely examining the corpse with a successful Medicine check (DC = 15 + your caster level) not only reveals what a successful Perception check does, but also reveals what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast.</p>	2	null	2	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	2	one corpse	instantaneous	none	no	3C01	45
6	Animate Armor	<p>Briefly control a suit of armor</p><p>You temporarily infuse a suit of armor with a magic force that allows it to move on its own and that directs its mechanisms. When you cast this spell, the armor acts and responds to your mental control for as long as you concentrate. Each round on your turn, the armor can perform either a move action or a standard action to attack. The armor can move up to 30 feet (or its listed speed using any of its available modes of movement, if powered armor or containing an armor upgrade that alters movement). When the armor attacks, it can either make an unarmed attack, dealing 4d8 + your caster level bludgeoning damage (or the listed damage plus its Strength modifier, for powered armor) or make an attack with any of the weapons mounted in its weapon slots or weapons with the integrated special property installed in its upgrade slots (if any); this deals the weapon&rsquo;s base damage for ranged attacks and the weapon&rsquo;s base damage plus the armor&rsquo;s Strength modifier for melee attacks. The armor has a bonus to attacks equal to 6 + your caster level. If the armor has no listed Strength score, it can apply a Strength bonus equal to your caster level.</p><p>Should the animated armor be attacked, its EAC and KAC are equal to 10 + the EAC and KAC bonus the armor provides. It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects, and it has the typical hardness and Hit Points for an item of its level. For the purpose of spells and effects that target the armor, it is treated as a construct with the technological and magical subtypes while the spell lasts.</p><p>This spell has no effect if cast on powered armor with a depleted battery or powered armor of an item level that exceeds your caster level.</p>	null	5	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	one unattended suit of armor	concentration, up to 1 round/level	none	no	ARM	156
7	Animate Dead	<p>Create controlled undead creatures out of target corpses.</p><p>This spell turns corpses into undead creatures that obey your spoken commands. The undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in place and attack any creature (or a specific kind of creature) entering the area. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed undead can&rsquo;t be animated again.</p><p>You can create one or more undead creatures with a total CR of no more than half your caster level. You can only create one type of undead with each casting of this spell. Creating undead requires special materials worth 1,000 credits &times; the total CR of the undead created; these materials are consumed as part of casting the spell.</p><p>The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only a number of undead whose total CR is no greater than your caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Once released, such undead have no particular feelings of loyalty to you, and in time they may grow in power beyond the undead you can create.</p><p>The corpses you use must be as intact as the typical undead of the type you choose to create. For example, a skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse (that has bones) or skeleton. A zombie can be created only from a creature with a physical anatomy.</p>	4	4	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	2	one or more corpses	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	340
8	Antiradiation	<p>Calm an area of radiation, the strength of which depends on your caster level.</p><p>You permeate radiation with mitigations from other realities, dissipating radiation effects in the spell&rsquo;s area; the radiation level you affect depends on your caster level, as shown on the table below. Once radiation has been dissipated, the environment in the area has no harmful effects from radiation, although this spell does not remove ongoing radiation-creating effects.<br />An&nbsp;<em>antiradiation</em>&nbsp;spell counters an&nbsp;<em>irradiate spell</em>, as long as your caster level is greater than the caster level of the creature or effect that created the&nbsp;<em>irradiate</em>&nbsp;effect.</p><table class="inner ds-table"><tbody><tr><td>CASTER LEVEL</td><td>RADIATION LEVEL</td></tr><tr><td>6th or lower</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>7th&ndash;9th</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>10th&ndash;16th</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>17th or higher</td><td>Severe</td></tr></tbody></table>	null	null	3	abjuration	1 standard action	null	10-ft.-radius spread; see text	4	null	instantaneous	null	null	COM	133
9	Arcane Eye	<p>Invisible floating eye moves 30 feet per round and sends you visual information.</p><p>You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. The sensor appears at any point within line of sight, but it can then travel beyond your line of sight without hindrance. An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a humanoid would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The arcane eye sees exactly as you would see if you were there.</p><p>The arcane eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The arcane eye can&rsquo;t enter another plane of existence, even through Drift travel or a magical gate or similar magical portal.</p><p>You must concentrate to use an arcane eye. If you do not concentrate, the sensor is inert until you concentrate again.</p>	null	4	null	divination (scrying)	10 minutes	magical sensor	null	6	null	1 minute/level (D)	none	no	CRB	340
10	Arcane Sight	<p>Magical sources become visible to you.</p><p>This spell allows you to see magic sources within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns information more quickly.</p><p>You know the location and caster level of all magic sources within your sight. If the magic sources are in line of sight, you can attempt a DC 28 Mysticism check (one check per source) to determine the school of magic involved in each source.</p><p>If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities and the caster level of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.</p><p>As with detect magic, you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not of artifacts.</p>	null	3	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 minute/level (D)	null	null	CRB	340

12	Augury	<p>Learn whether an action will be good or bad.</p><p>Casting&nbsp;<em>augury&nbsp;</em>can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. Casting this spell takes intense personal focus and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point.<br /><br />The chance for successfully receiving a meaningful reply is 75%; this roll is made secretly by the GM. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or it may be so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results.</p><ul><li>Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</li><li>Woe (for bad results).</li><li>Weal and woe (for both).</li><li>Nothing (for actions that have neither especially good nor especially bad results).</li></ul><p>If the augury isn&rsquo;t successful, you get the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result. A spellcaster who gets the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury.<br /><br />The augury can see only about 30 minutes into the future, so anything that might happen beyond that time frame does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. Multiple castings of&nbsp;<em>augury</em>&nbsp;by the same creature about the same topic use the same die result as the first casting.</p>	2	null	2	divination	1 minute	null	null	1	null	instantaneous	null	null	CRB	340
13	Awaken Computer	<p>Turn a computer into a friendly AI that you and up to four other creatures are authorized to use.</p><p>You infuse a computer with a spark of advanced technology, granting it an artificial personality. For this spell to take effect, you must have access to the computer, through either hacking it and bypassing any countermeasures it has or having unsecured access, but you don&rsquo;t need root access. Further, if the target computer&rsquo;s tier is equal to half your caster level or higher, you must expend credits equal to 5% of its base price while you cast this spell or the spell has no effect. This spell has no effect on computers that already have an artificial personality upgrade.</p><p>You decide the details of the computer&rsquo;s personality when you cast this spell, including its name, mannerisms, and sense of humor. The artificial personality recognizes you as its creator unless you remove that detail from its memory while casting. You can designate yourself and up to four other creatures as authorized users of the personality. This spell configures the personality with cunning and charm, granting it a bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks equal to 3 &times; its tier.</p>	null	4	null	transmutation	10 minutes	null	null	2	one computer	instantaneous	no (object)	no (object)	COM	133

Lesser remove condition and similar spells can end this effect.<br /><strong>2nd:</strong>&nbsp;As per the 1st-level version, but the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty and must attempt an additional saving throw each round until it fails or the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.

23	Battle Junkbot	<p>Create a temporary robot from random junk, turning it into a deadly combatant.</p><p>You turn a pile of technological junk into a vicious robot that can hunt down and attack your enemies.</p><p>You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above as long as the junk is found in a large enough quantity. Creating a battle junkbot also requires one ultra-capacity battery. Casting this spell drains all of the battery&rsquo;s charges.</p><p>While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with aggression and martial skills. A battle junkbot is Small, its KAC and EAC are each equal to 15 + your technomancer level, it has hardness 15, and it has a number of Hit Points equal to half of your own (but no Stamina Points). It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects. It has a land speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet with average maneuverability. For purposes of spells and effects that target the junkbot, it is treated as a construct with the magical and technological subtypes.</p><p>The battle junkbot has four hands. It is treated as if it had the Deadly Aim and Improved Combat Maneuver (Bull Rush, Grapple, Trip) feats. It has an attack bonus equal to 6 + your technomancer level; in one hand it wields a special buzzblade dagger that deals 6d8+6 damage instead of its normal damage, and a second hand carries a special light laser pistol that deals 6d6 damage instead of its normal damage. Damage from the junkbot&rsquo;s special weapons counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>You can give new basic commands to your battle junkbot telepathically on your turn as a move action, and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature. You are aware when the robot has made an attack or combat maneuver and whether or not it was successful, as well as when the battle junkbot has been attacked, has taken damage, or is destroyed, but you can perceive nothing else through this basic telepathic link.</p><p>When the battle junkbot is destroyed or this spell ends, the electronic equipment you used to create the junkbot falls apart into refuse, its circuitry fried beyond anything recognizable. You cannot use this refuse as a target to create another junkbot.</p>	null	6	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	at least 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text	1 round/level	none	no	CRB	341
24	Battlemind Link	<p>Creates a psychic link that gives a bonus to initiative and other benefits.</p><p>You create a strong temporary psychic link between two creatures that allows them to act almost as one. This spell works like lesser battlemind link, but the enhancement bonus to initiative rolls is +4, and the spell ends if the targets are more than 500 feet apart, rather than 200 feet apart. In addition, if the targets threaten the same enemy, they are considered to be flanking that foe regardless of their actual positions. When one of the targets hits a foe with a ranged attack, they can, as a reaction, apply the effects of covering fire or harrying fire against that foe for the other target of this spell. Finally, each target gains a +4 enhancement bonus to attacks of opportunity if they both attack the same creature due to the same triggering action on that creature&rsquo;s part.</p>	5	null	null	divination (mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	17	null	10 minutes/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	A!02	45

This spells also grants each target a +2 enhancement bonus to initiative rolls.

26	Bestow Curse	<p>Target takes &ndash;4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, and checks or 50% chance of not acting on each of its turns.</p><p>You place a terrible curse on the target, stealing either its overall competency or its ability to think and act on its feet. Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li>The target takes a &ndash;4 penalty to ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.</li><li>Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.</li></ul><p>You can also invent your own curse (see Afflictions on page 414 for a few ideas), but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a&nbsp;<em>break enchantment</em>,&nbsp;<em>miracle</em>,&nbsp;<em>remove affliction</em>, or&nbsp;<em>wish</em>&nbsp;spell.<br /><br />Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.&nbsp;<em>Bestow curse</em>&nbsp;counters&nbsp;<em>remove affliction</em>.</p>	3	null	null	necromancy (curse)	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	permanent	Will negates	yes	CRB	341
27	Bilocation	<p>The spell creates an identical copy of you in an adjacent space, along with everything you wear and carry other than artifacts.</p><p>The spell creates an identical copy of you in an adjacent space, along with everything you wear and carry other than artifacts. (If you carry an artifact, you decide which body retains it.) You exist in two places at once until the spell ends. Once the copy is created, it can travel an unlimited distance away from you. Your duplicate acts just after you do each round&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t have a separate initiative count. One of you can use a full round&rsquo;s worth of actions, and the other can take only a standard or a move action. Between the two of you, you can cast only one spell per round&mdash;unless you have a special ability that allows you to cast more than one spell when you have no duplicate, such as the quickened spell magic hack. You and your duplicate share sensory information, so if one of you is aware of or knows something, both of you do. The duplicate is another creature for most purposes, with the following exceptions.</p><p>You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share resources, including one pool of consumable items (including ammo), daily-use abilities (including from items) and spell slots, Hit Points, Resolve Points, and Stamina Points. If your duplicate casts a spell, your spell is expended, and if your duplicate uses a consumable item, that item is no longer available to you. Similarly, if an item one of you carries is permanently lost or destroyed, that item is lost or destroyed for both. Attacks, spells, and effects affect the two bodies as though they were one person, taking the worst effect applicable. For example, if both bodies are in the same explosive blast, you attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If you fail the saving throw against hold person, both bodies are paralyzed, and if one body catches a disease, both do. Both bodies count as one creature for spell effects, and they can&rsquo;t be chosen more than once for such effects. Any magical effect on you has its duration halved while you&rsquo;re bilocating. For example, the aforementioned hold person loses 2 rounds of duration each round it paralyzes you and your duplicate. Similarly, if you cast resistant armor on yourself, your duplicate is also affected, and the spell has a duration of 5 minutes per level. An effect that has its duration shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round.</p><p>In addition, if you attempt a skill check to recall knowledge, you roll only one check. Similarly, if you and your duplicate are in the same area, you roll only one Perception check to determine what you&rsquo;re both aware of, although you receive a +2 bonus to this check as if your duplicate aided you on it.</p><p>When this spell ends, you decide which body remains and which disappears. Any enduring effects continue to affect you.</p>	null	6	6	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 round/level (D)	null	null	A!05	51
28	Biotic Shroud	<p>Create a shroud that protects against attacks and lets you fly.</p><p>You conjure forth a mantle of organic, insectile nanites that encircle you. The density of the swarm provides you with partial concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 piercing damage, although you can allow anyone to touch you without them taking damage, for instance to deliver a beneficial touch spell. As a move action, you cause the nanites to cling tightly to you, granting you a fly speed of 20 feet with clumsy maneuverability as an extraordinary ability. When using the shroud to fly, you have no concealment due to it, and it cannot harm creatures that successfully attack you in melee. You can return the nanites to their protective configuration as a move action.</p>	null	4	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 round/level (D)	null	null	A!02	45

In addition, when you dismiss the spell as a reaction when striking a target, that target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take the weapon's damage again and become nauseated for 1d3+1 rounds.</p>	null	4	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	living taclash	null	11	null	1 round/level (D); see text	null	null	A!02	45

The created weapon functions as a standard taclash with the living weapon special property. You are considered to be proficient with this taclash, and you add 1-1/2 times your caster level to damage rolls with it in place of your Weapon Specialization bonus. In addition, the weapon has the nauseate critical hit effect.</p><p>The biotic taclash functions only for you, and once you create it, you can neither drop it nor be disarmed of it. As a move action, you can stow the biotic taclash, causing its component nanites to discorporate into individual nanobots that disperse over your body but remain while the spell lasts. During that time, you can cause the nanites to reincorporate to form the weapon again by taking another move action.</p><p>As a reaction when you strike a target with the biotic taclash, you can dismiss the spell to cause the weapon to discorporate into its component nanites, which then swarm over the target.

If the door would not completely block the targeted hallway, you can&rsquo;t cast this spell. Any creature in the spaces where the door appears is harmlessly shunted to a side of the door you choose. The door&rsquo;s statistics are those of a starship interior wall. It is airtight, and it protects against vacuum and radiation. When the spell ends, the door vanishes without a trace.</p>	null	3	null	conjuration (creation)	1 round	wall up to 20 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 5 feet thick	null	3	null	1 round/level (D)	none	no	COM	133

If you do so, you temporarily gain any stains and gifts that corruption grants to the target, and the target retains them. If a gift you gain has limited uses, you can use the gift only by expending 1 Resolve Point for each use.</p>	4	4	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	null	1 round/level (D)	none	no	SS3	53
33	Break Enchantment	<p>Free creatures from curses, enchantments, and transmutations.</p><p>This spell frees victims from curses, enchantments, and transmutations. Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +15) against a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC of the caster level check is equal to the DC of the curse.</p><p>If the spell is one that can&rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, break enchantment doesn&rsquo;t remove the curse from the item but it does free the victim from the item&rsquo;s effects.</p>	5	5	5	abjuration	1 minute	null	null	3	up to one creature per level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	341

In addition, when you fail a Charisma check or Charisma-based skill check when interacting with the target, you can reroll the check as a reaction. However, if you attempt the reroll, the target receives a new saving throw against the spell.

The cloud obscures all sight, including darkvision beyond 5 feet. The area counts as a smoke hazard, except a creature within the cloud has total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can&rsquo;t use sight to locate the target) against their attackers. In addition, the embers within the cloud deal 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures ending their turns within the cloud.<br />A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong wing (21+ mph) or stronger disperses the cloud in 1 round.

36	Call Cosmos	<p>Rain cosmic particles on targets, dealing 4d6 fire damage and 3d6 cold damage.</p><p>You evoke a vertical column of dangerous material from across the universe that rains down upon creatures in the area. This matter is made up of bits of burning stars and chunks of frozen comets, and it deals 4d6 fire damage and 3d6 cold damage to every creature in the area. This damage occurs only once, when the spell is cast. For the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration, the fallen starstuff makes the entire area difficult terrain, and thick, swirling clouds of particulate space matter magically block vision. This obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision and other vision-based senses (including vision-based blindsight and sense through), but doesn&rsquo;t prevent blindsense. A creature within 5 feet of its attacker has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can&rsquo;t use sight to locate the target). Additionally, the swirling cosmic particles are distracting to spellcasters in the area, who have a 20% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast in the area. At the end of the duration, the starstuff disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).</p>	5	null	null	evocation	1 standard action	null	cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)	5	null	1 round/level (D)	none	yes	CRB	342

You can try to give the target suggestions, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries of this check are not allowed.)

You can give the target suggestions, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.</p><p>An unintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; and so on. Unintelligent undead won&rsquo;t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.</p><p>Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell. You command the undead creature by voice and it understands you, no matter what language you speak.</p>	2	2	null	necromancy (sense-dependent)	1 standard action	null	null	3	one undead creature	1 day/level	Will negates, see text	yes	CRB	343

At the start of each commanded creature&rsquo;s action after the first, it can attempt another Will saving throw to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.</p>	5	null	null	enchantment (compulsion, language-dependent, mind-affecting)	null	null	null	3	up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 round/level	null	null	CRB	343

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of native creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or general state of the natural setting.</p><p>In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings&mdash;caves, caverns, and the like&mdash;the spell is less powerful and its radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlements, such as in cities, factories, and starships.</p>	5	null	null	divination	10 minutes	null	null	1	null	instantaneous	null	null	CRB	344

The insight you gain might help you greet someone properly, know whether physical contact (a handshake, for example) is appropriate, or how to eat without making a mess or insulting your host. In addition, when you attempt Diplomacy checks to change attitudes during the duration, you can lower the DC by 5. This spell does not replace careful study of a culture, nor does it give insight beyond events that occur during the duration.</p>	1	null	null	divination	reaction	null	null	1	you	1 hour/level	none (harmless)	no (harmless)	COM	134

The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it. You can&rsquo;t use this spell to read magic writing or encoded messages (though it does reveal if a message is magic or encoded), but you can use it to read raw computer code or foreign programming languages, allowing you to understand enough to attempt Computers checks on those materials without penalties.</p>	null	1	1	divination	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	10 minutes/level	null	null	CRB	344
52	Confusion	<p>Targets behave randomly for 1 round per level.</p><p>This spell causes confusion in all creatures in the area, making them unable to determine their actions. Any confused creature that is attacked automatically attacks or attempts to attack its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused at the start of its next turn. Note that a confused creature will not make attacks of opportunity against any foe that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). For confused creatures that have not been attacked, roll on the following table at the start of each affected creature&rsquo;s turn each round to see what it does in that round.<br /><br /></p><table class="inner"><tbody><tr><td><strong>D%</strong></td><td><strong>Behavior</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1&ndash;25</td><td>Act normally.</td></tr><tr><td>26&ndash;50</td><td>Do nothing but babble incoherently.</td></tr><tr><td>51&ndash;75</td><td>Deal 1d8 + Str modifier damage to self with item in hand.</td></tr><tr><td>76&ndash;100</td><td>Attack nearest creature.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br />A confused creature that can&rsquo;t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.

54	Contact Other Plane	<p>Ask questions of an extraplanar entity, with questionable results.</p><p>You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane further removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; &ldquo;Irrelevant,&rdquo; or some other one-word answer.<br />You must concentrate on maintaining the spell in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You can ask one question for every 2 caster levels. On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. Contacting a minor planar power is relatively safe but may not result in useful answers. For each question you ask, the GM secretly rolls 1d20.<br />1&ndash;2: The power gives you no answer, the spell ends, and you must attempt a DC 7 Intelligence check. On a failed check, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for a week and you are unable to cast spells for that period.<br />3&ndash;5: You receive a random answer to the question.<br />6&ndash;10: You receive an incorrect answer to the question. Based on the nature and needs of the creature contacted, this may be a lie designed to harm you.<br />11&ndash;15: You receive no answer to the question.<br />16 or More: You receive a truthful and useful one-word answer. If the question can&rsquo;t be truthfully answered in this way, no answer is received.<br />Contact with minds further removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed by the power&rsquo;s sheer strangeness and force, but it also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. You can add any value from +1 to +5 to the d20 roll to represent contacting increasingly powerful planar beings. However, on a roll of 1 or 2, the result is still no answer, the spell ends, and you must attempt an Intelligence check to avoid losing Intelligence and Charisma. The DC of this Intelligence check is increased by the same amount added to the d20 check to contact a planar creature.</p>	5	5	5	divination	10 minutes	null	null	1	null	concentration	null	null	CRB	344
55	Control Atmosphere	<p>Alter the corrosiveness, density, or toxicity of the surrounding atmosphere.</p><p>You can alter the atmosphere within the spell&rsquo;s area to cause it to become more like the atmosphere of another planet. You can alter one aspect of the atmosphere&mdash;its corrosiveness, density, or toxicity. The possible effects of each of these changes are detailed below.</p><p>Corrosiveness: You can make the atmosphere corrosive. Each creature and object in the area when you cast the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 5d6 acid damage. Creatures and objects that remain in the area take 3d6 additional acid damage every 10 minutes (Fortitude half).</p><p>Alternatively, you can make a normally corrosive atmosphere noncorrosive. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell&rsquo;s area deals no acid damage for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Density: You can make the atmosphere in the area one step thinner (going from severely thick to thick, thick to normal, normal to thin, or thin to severely thin) or thicker (going from severely thin to thin, thin to normal, normal to thick, or thick to severely thick). The spell cannot make an atmosphere thicker than severely thick or thinner than severely thin.</p><p>In addition to the normal long-term effects of being in an atmosphere thinner or thicker than a creature is acclimated to, each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. This is true even for creatures with environmental protection from equipment (such as armor), as the air within the armor is affected on a failed saving throw. Creatures that do not need to breathe are not affected by changes in atmospheric density.</p><p>If the air is thicker than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, that creature becomes sickened. For every step beyond the first that the air is thicker than the target&rsquo;s acclimation, it takes a &ndash;1 penalty to its save against this effect. If the air is thinner than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, it is fatigued. For every step beyond the first that the air is thinner than the target&rsquo;s acclimation, it takes a &ndash;1 penalty to its saving throw against this effect. The effect ends if the creature moves out of the area, and it is not required to attempt a new saving throw upon reentering the area (instead it is subject only to the normal dangers of thicker or thinner air).</p><p>Toxicity: You can make the atmosphere toxic. Each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. Creatures with environmental protection from equipment already active (such as armor) are not exposed to the toxic atmosphere. A creature that fails its save contracts bubonic plague (no save) and immediately moves to the weakened state. Creatures that enter the area of toxic atmosphere later are exposed to inhaled bubonic plague and follow the normal disease rules for contracting the disease and progressing on the physical disease track. The disease is nonmagical, and those infected are still infected when the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.</p><p>Alternatively, you can make a normally toxic atmosphere nontoxic. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell&rsquo;s area does not expose those who breathe it to any toxic disease for the duration of the spell.</p>	4	null	4	transmutation	1 standard action	null	30-ft.-radius spread	4	null	10 minutes/level	Fortitude partial (see text)	no	PWD	204
56	Control Gravity	<p>Alter gravity in an area.</p><p>You can control gravity in an area, causing it to reverse, become zero-g, or become extremely strong. A creature or object within the area that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected (though if it stays in the area, it must succeed at a new save each round or become affected), but it might still suffer secondary effects (such as an object flying up from reversed gravity, or an object falling upon it when the spell ends). You choose how to have this spell affect gravity when you cast it, and you cannot change it without recasting the spell. If two control gravity spells affect the same area, they negate each other in the area of overlap.</p><p>If you reverse gravity in an area, you cause unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the affected area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the spell&rsquo;s area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling in either direction.</p><p>If you increase gravity in the area, creatures and objects weigh twice as much as normal, move at half speed, can jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by one step (from average to clumsy, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Acrobatics check to fly to remain in the air.</p><p>An area of zero-g works like the zero-g environment (see page 402). You can also use this spell to make areas of zero-g, heavy gravity, or light gravity act as normal gravity for the duration (see page 402).</p>	6	6	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	up to one 10-ft. cube/2 levels (S)	4	null	1 round/level (D)	Fortitude negates, see text	no	CRB	345
57	Control Machines	<p>Command technological constructs within range telepathically.</p><p>You wrest control of the target constructs and command them telepathically. You can issue commands to any number of controlled constructs on your turn, beginning when you cast this spell, as part of the concentration required to sustain its duration (a standard action).</p><p>If any of the constructs are under the control of a hostile creature, that controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s) to negate this spell&rsquo;s effect. Each construct under the control of another creature grants its controlling creature a separate saving throw to negate the effect for that construct.</p><p>While this spell is in effect, the affected constructs follow any command you give them, even if it would be dangerous to the controlled constructs. At the end of the spell, the constructs revert to their normal behavior. If they are intelligent, they know and remember that you used magic to control them.</p>	null	5	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	constructs of the technological subtype with individual CRs no greater than your level + 1 and a total CR no greater than twice your level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	concentration, up to 1 round/level	Will negates	no	CRB	345

You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. No matter what, the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the targets revert to their normal behavior.</p><p>If any of the undead are under the control of a hostile creature, that controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = the spell&rsquo;s DC) to negate this spell&rsquo;s effect if the creature failed its initial saving throw. Each undead under the control of another creature grants its controlling creature a separate saving throw to negate the effect for that undead.</p><p>Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them, and they may seek revenge after the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.</p>	6	6	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	3	undead creatures with individual CRs no greater than your level + 1 and a total CR no greater than twice your level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 minute/level	Will negates	yes	CRB	345
59	Corrosive Haze	<p>Cloud deals 4d8 acid damage per round, plus 10 additional damage.</p><p>A 5-foot cloud of acid-resistant nanites continually converts nearby water vapor into deadly acid. You can create the cloud in the same square as a creature and move it up to 30 feet in any direction as a move action on your turn. If the cloud enters (or is created in) a square containing a creature, it can&rsquo;t move any farther that round and deals 4d6 acid damage to that creature (Reflex negates). The acidic cloud also corrodes any unattended objects along its path, dealing them 4d8 acid damage.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t move the cloud, it remains where it is; if it shares its square with any creature at the beginning of your turn, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take 4d8 acid damage. Any creature that takes damage from the cloud takes 10 additional acid damage at the end of its next turn.</p>	null	4	null	evocation (acid)	1 standard action	5-ft.-diameter cloud of acid	null	4	null	1 round/level	Reflex negates	yes	CRB	346
60	Cosmic Eddy	<p>Whirlwind deals 4d6 damage and knocks creatures prone.</p><p>You pull dormant mystical energy from the land and objects around you and use it to create a swirling eddy that batters your foes and can hinder their movement. The eddy deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area. Additionally, creatures in the area are knocked prone and are reduced to half speed while the spell is in effect. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes only half damage and is not knocked prone, but it is still reduced to half speed. Flying creatures within the eddy&rsquo;s area must attempt an Acrobatics check to fly (DC equals the spell&rsquo;s save DC) each round. Failure means the creature cannot move for that round.</p><p>The spell deals damage and knocks creatures prone only once. However, if a creature leaves the spell&rsquo;s area and then returns, it is subject to the damage and other effects described above again (and can attempt another Reflex saving throw). Similarly, if a creature is not in this spell&rsquo;s area when it is first cast but later moves into it, it is subject to the damage and other effects described above.</p><p>Small, unattended items (no more than light bulk) are also thrown around in the eddy&rsquo;s area. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, such items land in a randomly determined space within the spell&rsquo;s area.</p>	4	null	4	evocation	1 standard action	null	20-ft.-radius spread	4	null	1 round/level (D)	Reflex partial, see text	yes	CRB	346
61	Create Ammunition	<p>Create a specific type of ammunition, such as arrows or a battery.</p><p>You create a specific type of ammunition, such as arrows or a battery, and conjure it in hand or a place within range. You can create ammunition with an item level of 1 or 2, and you create a number of charges or pieces of ammunition as if you had purchased the ammunition (for example, 20 arrows or a battery with 20 charges). If you use this spell to create a battery, the battery can be used for any function a battery performs. This spell cannot create ammunition made from special materials or with any special quality, and it cannot create grenades, rockets, missiles, or the like. The ammunition disappears when the duration ends.</p>	null	1	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	3	null	1 minute/level (D)	null	null	COM	134

You must make a ranged attack against the target&rsquo;s EAC to ensure this spell hits the necessary weak spots in the target&rsquo;s head, but you can add your key ability score modifier to this attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher. If you hit and the target fails a Fortitude saving throw, it takes 18d8 damage. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it instead takes 4d8 damage.

The creature also gains a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against the following effects: mind-affecting, paralysis, and stunning effects; ability damage; ability drain; and any effect that requires a Fortitude saving throw (unless the effect works on objects or is harmless).<br />For effects that target creatures by type, the target creature counts as both its own type and undead (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).<br />When the spell ends, the above effects end and the target gains the exhausted condition.</p>	3	3	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	2	one willing living creature	10 minutes/level	none	no	NSP	155

This spell must target a construct that is not already programmed or tasked with harming you. The target construct must have a CR lower than or equal to your level. If the target construct is under the control of another creature, the controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = the spell&rsquo;s DC) to negate this spell&rsquo;s effect.<br />While this spell is in effect, the construct is under your control. On your turn starting when you cast this spell, you must direct it to attack a target; the construct then pursues and attacks this target as best it can. You can change which target the construct attacks as part of your concentration to continue this spell&rsquo;s duration (a standard action). When you stop concentrating or when the spell&rsquo;s duration otherwise ends, the construct immediately stops following your commands to attack.</p>	null	4	null	enchantment	1 standard action	null	null	2	one nonhostile construct of the technological subtype; see text	concentration, up to 1 round/level	none	yes	CRB	348

If the target is poisoned or diseased, you automatically detect that fact and can determine the exact type of poison or disease with a successful DC 20 Intelligence or Wisdom check. If you are trained in Life Science or Medicine (depending on the nature of the poison or disease), you can attempt a DC 20 check of that skill if you fail your Wisdom or Intelligence check. If the target is cursed or suffering from a similar affliction, you must succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence or Wisdom check to determine that fact. You can then determine the exact nature of the curse with a successful DC 25 Mysticism check.</p>	0	0	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	3	one creature or object	instantaneous	none	yes (harmless)	CRB	348
79	Detect Augmentation	<p>Detect the presence of augmentations in the area.</p><p>You detect the presence of augmentations installed within creatures you can see within the area, which appear to you as glowing outlines around the systems in which the augmentations are installed. The spell allows you to determine the type of augmentation, such as biotech, cybernetic, magitech, or necrotech, and its item level, but it does not reveal the function of the augmentation.

You can&rsquo;t detect magical traps in this way, as they are created with additional magic that wards them from this common spell. Each round you concentrate on the same area, you can determine if one magic source you detect is from a spell, magic item, or other effect, and the caster level (or item level) of the effect. You can&rsquo;t determine if there are magic sources in areas you can&rsquo;t see, or if there was a magic source in an area at one time but that has since expired.</p>	0	0	0	divination	1 standard action	null	cone-shaped emanation	17	null	concentration, up to 1 minute/level	none	no	CRB	348

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>	1	1	null	divination	1 standard action	null	120-ft. spherical emanation centered on you	19	null	10 minutes/level	none	no	CRB	348

You can&rsquo;t determine if there are technological items in areas you can&rsquo;t see, nor can you detect technological traps in this way.<br />The information this spell provides allows you to differentiate between charged items and items that replenish charges, but it does not provide any further information nor does it tell you, for example, how many charges an item currently has or how many maximum charges it can hold. This spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>	null	1	null	divination	1 standard action	null	cone-shaped burst	17	null	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	349
83	Detect Thoughts	<p>&ldquo;Listen&rdquo; to surface thoughts.</p><p>You detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures around you. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or target.<br />1st Round: You detect the presence or absence of thoughts from conscious creatures that have Intelligence scores of at least 1 (or an Intelligence modifier of &ndash;5) or higher.<br />2nd Round: You detect the number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score (or modifier) of each. If the highest Intelligence score is 26 (or a modifier of +8) or higher and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score (or 5 points higher than your own Intelligence modifier), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell doesn&rsquo;t let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can&rsquo;t see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.<br />3rd Round: You can read the surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target who succeeds at its Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 or an Intelligence modifier of &ndash;4 or lower) have simple, instinctual thoughts.<br />Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>	1	null	1	divination (mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	cone-shaped emanation	17	null	concentration, up to 1 minute/level	Will negates, see text	no	CRB	349
84	Digital Doorway	<p>Teleport from one computer to another within range.</p><p>You gain the ability to step into a piece of electronic equipment currently connected to a communication or information network (such as a comm unit or a computer connected to an infosphere), converting yourself into digital information and traveling along the network. Once uploaded onto a network, you teleport out from any device within 3,000 feet of the device that you entered; if no such device is in range, you emerge from the same device you entered. You are instantly aware of all unsecured devices connected to the same network as the one you entered, and you can attempt a Computers check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the item&rsquo;s level) to detect other devices (this does not require an action); a single check renders you aware of all devices whose DC to detect you exceeded. If the item is a computer, your Computers check result must also exceed the DC required to successfully hack it (Core Rulebook 214). This movement acts as the teleport spell, except there is no chance of missing your destination.<br />When attempting to enter or exit a computer with one or more countermeasures, you automatically trigger any countermeasures that are not successfully disabled. When you emerge from a computer, you can attempt one Computers check, with the result compared to the DC of each countermeasure in place on that computer (this does not require an action); you suffer the effects of all countermeasures with a DC higher than the result of your check. Some countermeasures triggered in this manner are exceptionally dangerous, as noted below.<br />Feedback: The digital virus uploaded into your data causes you to become exposed to the mindfire disease, but the disease has a save DC of 15 + half the item level of the destination device.<br />Firewall: You arrive at the destination prone, and you remain flat-footed and off-target for 1 minute.<br />Wipe: Your recent memories are scrambled, with minor elements removed, causing you to be confused for a number of rounds equal to half the item level of the destination device (minimum 1 round).</p>	null	4	null	conjuration (teleport)	1 standard action	null	null	1	you	1 hour/level or until expended; see text	null	null	PWD	205
85	Dimension Door	<p>Teleport a short distance.</p><p>You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired&mdash;whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating its direction. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You can also bring up to four additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to their maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. After using this spell, you can&rsquo;t take any other actions until your next turn (and each creature traveling with you can&rsquo;t take any other actions until its next turn).</p><p>If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you each take 1d6 damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take 2d6 additional damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take 4d6 additional damage and the spell simply fails.</p>	null	4	4	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	5	you and touched objects or touched willing or unconscious creatures	instantaneous	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	CRB	349

On a hit, the target is covered in a shimmering field that prevents planar travel. The target can&rsquo;t be affected by any effect that causes the target to move extradimensionally or to another plane, such as teleportation, summoning, plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and so on.

You know if the target deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying.

If the spell targets an object with charges, the object loses all of its remaining charges. If the object is powered by electrical means other than charges, its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds. If the spell targets a creature not of the technological subtype, it affects a random charged or electrically powered item in that creature&rsquo;s possession. If the target is a construct with the technological subtype, it is staggered and cannot use any energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A construct with the technological subtype that is affected by this spell can attempt a Fortitude saving throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect.</p>	null	3	null	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	4	one creature or technological object	instantaneous	Fortitude negates (object)	no	CRB	350

Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature&rsquo;s possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.</p><p>Targeted Discharge: If this spell targets a single creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target&rsquo;s charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you have.</p>	null	6	null	abjuration	null	null	null	4	null	null	null	null	CRB	350

You can seem up to 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You can&rsquo;t change your creature type (although you can appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could merely add or obscure a minor feature, or you could look like an entirely different person or gender.</p><p>The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to the Disguise check (since it counts as altering your form). A creature that interacts with you directly can attempt a Will saving throw to recognize your appearance as an illusion.</p>	1	1	1	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	10 minutes/level (D)	null	null	CRB	350
92	Disintegrate	<p>Ray reduces one creature or object to dust.</p><p>Immense power shoots from your finger, with the potential to disintegrate a target where it stands.</p><p>When you cast this spell, a thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a ranged attack against your target&rsquo;s EAC, but you can add your key ability score bonus to this attack instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher. If you hit, the target takes 14d20 damage. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature&rsquo;s equipment is unaffected. Only one target is affected per casting of this spell.</p><p>When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, but it does not affect other magical effects that are not an object, creature, or force effect.</p><p>A creature or object that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw is partially affected, taking only 4d20 damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 Hit Points, the target is entirely disintegrated.</p>	null	6	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one creature or object, or up to a 10-ft. cube of nonliving matter	instantaneous	Fortitude partial (object)	yes	CRB	350

You can improve the spell&rsquo;s chance of success by presenting one object or substance that the target fears, hates, or otherwise opposes; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your caster level check to overcome the target&rsquo;s spell resistance (if any), and the save DC of the spell increases by 2. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, certain rare items might work twice as well, providing a +2 circumstance bonus to the caster level check to overcome spell resistance and increasing the spell&rsquo;s save DC by 4.<br />4th: When you cast dismissal as a 4th-level spell, it affects one extraplanar creature.</p>	4	4	4	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	3	see text	instantaneous	Will negates, see text	yes	CRB	350

95	Dispel Magic	<p>Cancel one magical spell or effect.</p><p>You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster&rsquo;s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled.<br />You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: as a targeted dispel or as a counter.<br /><strong>Targeted Dispel:</strong>&nbsp;One creature, object, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as &ldquo;that burning wall&rdquo; or &ldquo;the spell that&rsquo;s giving him those duplicates&rdquo;). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. If you succeed, the spell ends. If you don&rsquo;t specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random.<br />If you target a force, an object, or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant), you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.<br />If the object that you target is a magic item, you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item&rsquo;s nonmagical physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed holy laser pistol is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br />You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.<br /><strong>Counter:</strong>&nbsp;You can use the energy of dispel magic to disrupt the casting of other spells. First, select an opponent and take the ready action to cast dispel magic when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered, you cast dispel magic and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell. The DC is equal to 11 + the other spellcaster&rsquo;s caster level. If the check is successful and the target is in range, the spell fails and has no result.</p>	3	3	3	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	4	one creature, object, spell, or spellcaster	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	351
96	Dispel Magic, Greater	<p>Cancel multiple magical spells or effects.</p><p>This spell functions like dispel magic, except it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures. You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counter.<br /><strong>Targeted Dispel:</strong>&nbsp;This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but you can dispel one spell for every 4 caster levels you have, attempting a separate dispel check for each spell. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any curse that remove affliction can remove, even if dispel magic can&rsquo;t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse&rsquo;s DC.<br /><strong>Area Dispel:</strong>&nbsp;When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Attempt one dispel check and apply that check to each creature or object in the area, as if it were targeted by dispel magic. If you don&rsquo;t specify spells and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel spells at random. Magic items themselves are not affected by an area dispel but additional magical effects on them may be dispelled.<br />For each ongoing spell effect whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the result of the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the result of the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.<br />If an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell is in the area, apply the result of the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.<br />You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.<br /><strong>Counter:</strong>&nbsp;This functions as countering with dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus to your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell.</p>	5	5	5	abjuration	null	null	null	4	null	null	null	null	CRB	352

You can select up to 5 minutes of continuous memory, or you can select every memory associated with one person, place, or object you name when you cast this spell. If you select continuous memory, you lose those memories, and if you try to recall them, you remember a blank gap instead of any details. If you select a person, place, or object, you remember events related to that thing, but not the presence or details of the thing you named. For example, if after a visit to Castrovel with your sister you use this spell to forget Castrovel, you remember traveling with your sister, but you forget where you went. Alternatively, if you used this spell to forget your sister, you remember going to Castrovel with someone, but not who was with you.<br />Anyone touching the object into which you placed your memories can recall those memories by speaking a command word that you designate at the time of casting. Alternatively, you can designate no command word so that no one can recall the memories when touching the object. If the object is destroyed, the memories placed within return to you.</p>	4	null	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	one object of negligible bulk	instantaneous	none (object)	no (object)	COM	134
98	Displacement	<p>Attacks miss target 50% of the time.</p><p>The target of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, displacement doesn&rsquo;t prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals the target&rsquo;s true location and negates the miss chance. If a creature with blindsense can also see the displaced creature, the visual and blindsense information combined are enough for the creature with blindsense to attack the displaced creature without a miss chance, unlike normal for blindsense.</p>	null	3	3	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	1 round/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	352

Casting this spell requires you to expend 1 Resolve Point. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If you don&rsquo;t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The chance for a correct divination is 75%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.<br />As with augury, multiple castings of divination about the same topic by the same caster use the same die result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.</p>	4	null	null	divination	10 minutes	null	null	1	null	instantaneous	null	null	CRB	352

101	Dominate Person	<p>Control humanoid telepathically.</p><p>You fire a bright purple ray at your target, making a ranged attack against your target&rsquo;s EAC, but you can add your key ability score bonus to this attack instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher.<br />If you hit and your target fails its Will saving throw, you establish a telepathic link with the target&rsquo;s mind and can control its actions. If you and the target have a common language, you can generally force the target to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stand still.&rdquo; You know what the target is experiencing, but you don&rsquo;t receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.<br />By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the target, though it still can&rsquo;t communicate with you. You don&rsquo;t actually see through the target&rsquo;s eyes, but you still get a good idea of what&rsquo;s going on.<br />The target resists this control, and any target forced to take actions against its nature can attempt a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited as long as you and the target are on the same plane. You don&rsquo;t need to see the target to control it.<br />If you don&rsquo;t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each following day, the target can attempt a new saving throw to throw off the domination. You can be prevented from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the target is under the effects of some spells, but such effects don&rsquo;t automatically dispel the domination.</p>	5	null	null	enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting)	1 round	null	null	3	one humanoid	1 day/level; see text	Will negates	yes	CRB	352

The target weapons must deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage or the spell has no effect. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the metal plating on the weapons grants them the ability to overcome DR/silver and bypass DR/magic for the spell&rsquo;s duration.<br />If your caster level is 8th or higher, you can have weapons affected by this spell bypass DR/adamantine rather than DR/ silver. Weapons affected by this version of the spell are not considered adamantine for any other purpose (such as the ability to bypass hardness). If your caster level is 16th or higher, you can instead have affected weapons bypass DR that is bypassed by any other one metal with which you are familiar (either from having succeeded at a skill check to identify the weaknesses of a creature with DR, or from a successful Physical Science skill check to identify some other metal when you encountered it). Such weapons do not gain any other benefit from being made of the selected material.</p>	null	2	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	one melee or projectile weapon/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; see text	1 round/level	Fortitude negates (harmless, object)	yes (object)	ARM	157

These embers have no effect except for providing dim light in those squares. The embers disappear at the start of your next turn. As a reaction to another creature moving into a square of embers, you can ignite that square, causing flames to leap up and burn that creature. The affected creature takes 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex half), and gains the burning condition for 1d4 points of fire damage on a failed Reflex save.

If the item is so large that it can&rsquo;t fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the material is destroyed. This is an instantaneous effect.<br />You can employ entropic grasp in combat by making a melee attack against your opponent&rsquo;s EAC. If you hit, you instantaneously reduce a manufactured armor&rsquo;s KAC and EAC bonus by 3 (to a minimum of a +0 bonus). Damaged armor can be repaired using the Engineering skill; with a successful check, the armor&rsquo;s armor bonuses are restored to their original values. Against a manufactured creature (generally constructs, but not undead), this attack instead deals 6d12 damage.<br />Weapons and equipment in use by an opponent are more difficult to affect with this spell. You attempt a sunder combat maneuver against the item. If successful, you deal 6d6 damage to the weapon or item.<br />Used in combat, this spell lasts 1 round per level, and you can make one melee attack each round on future rounds as a standard action. The target can attempt a save to negate each melee attack, but success does not end the spell.<br />Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>	null	3	3	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	one nonmagical manufactured object (or the volume of the object within a 3-ft.-radius of the touched point) or one manufactured creature touched each round	see text	Fortitude negates (object)	no	CRB	353
118	Erase	<p>Remove writings of either magical or mundane nature.</p><p>Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from any written storage, including paper, computers, or similar devices. You remove up to 1,500 words worth of text (for computer files, this could be a 1,500-word data file or 1,500 words of computer code). With this spell, you can remove magic runes and glyphs created by spells of 3rd-level and lower.<br />Nonmagical writing in a book or manual is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Magical writing and computer programs must be touched (either directly or by touching the physical drive that holds the file) to be erased, and you must also succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level for the magical writing or the item level of the computer&rsquo;s drive. Computers generally keep backups on a round-by-round basis, and when you erase code from a computer, it takes 1 round for the computer to access its backups. If you erase a file that stores continuous data (like a camera feed), the computer won&rsquo;t be able to recover the missing round. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase writing that is part of a trap (magical or otherwise), you set off that trap.</p>	null	1	1	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	one written data set	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	353
119	Ethereal Jaunt	<p>You become ethereal for 1 round per level.</p><p>You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are on the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.<br />An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear events and creatures on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet and many kinds of senses (such as blindsense and blindsight) don&rsquo;t work across the planar boundary.<br />Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally, but force effects originating on the Ethereal Plane don&rsquo;t affect targets on the Material Plane. An ethereal creature can&rsquo;t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures and objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as you would if you were both on the Material Plane.<br />If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet that you so travel.</p>	6	6	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 round/level (D)	null	null	CRB	354

Movement through an area of etheric shards is halved, even for incorporeal creatures, and creatures entering a 5-foot cube filled with etheric shards take 1d8 slashing damage and must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or gain the bleeding 1 condition. The damage from this bleeding stacks with itself and other sources of bleeding. A creature that remains motionless within the area takes no damage, but such a creature is flat-footed unless it moves enough to defend itself, which forces it to take damage and attempt a saving throw.<br />Etheric shards are a magical trap. A creature trained in Mysticism and within 30 feet of the area can attempt a DC 35 Perception check to sense the shards. The shards cannot be disabled, but they can be dispelled.</p>	3	3	3	evocation (force)	1 standard action	null	one 10-ft. cube/level	4	null	1 hour/level (D)	Reflex partial or Reflex negates, see text	no	A!05	52

If you send the battery through a narrow opening, you must make a ranged attack (usually against an Armor Class of 10 for a narrow opening or an Armor Class of 15 for an extremely narrow opening) to avoid hitting the side and detonating it prematurely.</p>	null	3	3	evocation (fire)	1 standard action	null	20-ft.-radius burst	4	null	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes	CRB	354

The targets must all be within 20 feet of each other. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so on. The affected targets instantly fall slower, at a rate of just 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet). The targets take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. This spell doesn&rsquo;t affect charging or flying creatures.</span><br /><br /><span>For each target, this casting of the spell lasts until that target lands or 1 round per caster level (whichever happens first).</span><br /><br /><span>The 1st-level version of this spell can be cast as a reaction, but when you do so, you can&rsquo;t take a standard action on your next round.</span><br /><br /><strong>2nd</strong><span>: When you cast&nbsp;</span><em>flight&nbsp;</em><span>as a 2nd-level spell, you can target yourself or one willing or unconscious creature or unattended object (total weight up to 100 pounds or 10 bulk per level) at close range. The spell allows you to move the target up or down as you wish. Each round as a move action, you can mentally direct the target up or down as much as 20 feet. You can&rsquo;t move the target horizontally. A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls, the second a &ndash;2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum of &ndash;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &ndash;1.</span><br /><br /><span>This casting of the spell lasts 1 minute per caster level and is dismissible.</span><br /><br /><strong>3rd</strong><span>: When you cast&nbsp;</span><em>flight&nbsp;</em><span>as a 3rd-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and give it the power of flight. The target can fly at a speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.

Unattended objects are automatically moved 10 feet toward the singularity each round. If a creature or object is moved into the square that contains the singularity, it is sucked inside it and takes 12d6 damage at the end of its turn each round it remains within that space.</span><br /><br /><span>A creature drawn into the singularity can take no actions except a full action to try to escape (it still takes damage during the rounds it attempts to escape). A creature must succeed at either an Athletics check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; your mystic level) or a DC 22 Strength check to escape the singularity. The singularity can hold up to four Medium creatures or objects (two Small creatures or objects count as one Medium creature, and so on); if it would pull in additional creatures, those creatures are simply pulled into a square adjacent to the singularity.</span><br /><br /><span>A creature within 50 feet of the singularity has its speed reduced by half when it moves away from the singularity. However, it can move at double its normal speed when moving toward the singularity. If a creature moves within 30 feet of the singularity at any point in its movement, it is subject to the combat maneuver described above. A creature that moves neither toward nor away from the singularity moves at its normal speed.</span><br /><br /><span>When this spell ends, the singularity disappears, and creatures and objects that were sucked into the singularity appear in the space where you conjured it (or as close as possible to that space, if they can&rsquo;t all fit within it).</span></p>	6	null	null	conjuration (creation)	1 round	5-ft.-cube gravitational singularity; see text	null	4	null	1 round/level (D)	none	no	CRB	357

Each creature in the area when the spell takes effect is knocked prone unless it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. Any creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be drawn 15 feet closer to the center of the area. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity.

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means the creature can&rsquo;t move that round and must then succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone, while failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill on page 135 for details). A creature that doesn&rsquo;t move on its turn doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt this check and isn&rsquo;t considered flat-footed. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Unattended material objects are always affected by this spell. If you attempt to affect an object in a creature&rsquo;s possession, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate the effect. If the creature fails the initial saving throw, it immediately drops the item and must attempt a new save each round it attempts to pick up, hold, or use the item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +5 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to escape a grapple and a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against grapple combat maneuvers.</span></p>	null	1	1	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	3	null	1 minute/level (D)	Reflex partial, see text	no	CRB	357

The target creature must remain quiet and still while the hologram plays or the spell and hologram end.</span><br /></span></p>	3	null	null	divination	1 full action	null	null	2	one living or deceased sentient creature; see text	instantaneous	Will negates, see text	no	CRB	359

You can teleport to anywhere you are familiar with on the planet you are on while casting the spell, or you can teleport to any other planet in the same solar system. You must have an unambiguous idea of which world you wish to travel to (&ldquo;the third planet from the sun&rdquo; is an acceptable destination, but &ldquo;a habitable world with oceans&rdquo; is not). If you have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without a chance of failure; otherwise, you arrive at a location that would not immediately be life threatening.

If the target is a creature, any gear it is carrying vanishes as well. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the target unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.</span><br /><br /><span>The spell ends if the target attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell or harmful effect targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Actions directed at unattended objects don&rsquo;t break the spell. Spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon security forces and have them attack, start a trash compactor with foes inside, remotely trigger traps, and so forth.</span></p>	null	2	2	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object no more than 10 bulk/level	1 minute/level (D)	Will negates (harmless, object), see text	yes (harmless, object)	CRB	362

The target is missing from technological images captured while the spell lasts, security cameras do not display the target, microphones pick up no sounds the target makes, and the target cannot trigger technological traps. This spell creates disadvantages for the target, as well. Talking on a comm unit is impossible while subjected to this spell, and automatic doors do not open for the target.</span><br /><span>Items dropped, put down, or thrown by the target become visible to technology. Items picked up disappear if tucked into clothing or a bag carried by the target. Light remains visible to technology, but a source of light might be invisible. If any part of an item the target carries extends more than 10 feet from the target, that part becomes visible to technology. This spell ends under the same circumstances as an invisibility spell.</span></p>	null	2	null	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object	1 minute/level (D)	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	COM	137

Individuals in the group can&rsquo;t see one another. Any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group loses the benefit of this spell.

189	Irradiate	<p>Flood area with dangerous radiation.</p><p>This spell floods the area of effect with dangerous radiation. The strength of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as detailed below. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect. Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The saving throw to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell rather than the standard save DC for radiation.</p>

Alternatively, you can instead touch an electrical device a target is wearing (or a target that is an electrical device, such as a robot) with your hand, gaining a +2 bonus to your attack roll. Either way, if your attack hits, the electrical device surges out of control, dealing 4d6 electricity damage to your target.</span><br /><br /><span>Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</span></p>	null	1	1	evocation (electricity)	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object	instantaneous	none	yes	CRB	363
191	Junk Armor	<p>Turn junk into light armor or upgrade light armor to heavy armor.</p><p><span>You turn a pile of technological junk into a suit of light armor, or use it to upgrade a suit of light armor to heavy armor. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.</span><br /><br /><span>You can cause the armor to be created on yourself or an adjacent willing or unconscious ally. Light or heavy armor you create requires proficiency to use without penalties as normal. If you use this spell to create light armor, the armor has an EAC bonus equal to your caster level, a KAC bonus equal to your caster level + 2, and a maximum Dex bonus equal to 1 + onequarter your caster level. Using&nbsp;</span><em>junk armor</em><span>&nbsp;to temporarily turn light armor into heavy armor increases the armor&rsquo;s EAC bonus by 1 and its KAC bonus by 2, reduces its maximum Dexterity bonus by 3, and worsens its armor check penalty by 2.</span></p>	null	1	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	2	null	24 hours (D)	none	no	PWD	205

Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.<br />You are automatically proficient with this melee weapon, and you add 1-1/2 times your caster level to damage rolls with it (in place of a Weapon Specialization bonus). A junksword functions only for its creator, and once created it cannot leave your hand. Should you wish to sheathe it, the junksword obliges by collapsing into a wreath of junk that surrounds your hand like a glove.<br />You can grant your junksword additional abilities based on the spell&rsquo;s level. You can change one modification to your junksword as a move action, or you can completely reconfigure all of its modifications as a full action.<br /><strong>1st:</strong>&nbsp;Your junksword deals 1d4 bludgeoning and slashing damage and has the analog weapon special property. In addition, you can grant your junksword up to two of the following special properties: block, disarm, nonlethal, reach, or trip.<br /><strong>2nd:</strong>&nbsp;Your junksword deals 1d8 bludgeoning and slashing damage and has the analog weapon special property. In addition, you can grant your junksword up to three of the special properties from the 1st-level list.<br /><strong>3rd:</strong>&nbsp;Your junksword has either the analog or powered (capacity 30, usage 2) weapon special property (your choice). It deals 2d4 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it&rsquo;s an analog weapon, or 2d4 electricity damage if it&rsquo;s a powered weapon. In addition, you can grant your junksword up to three of the special properties from the 1st-level list, plus the staggered critical effect. If you select the powered option, your junksword&rsquo;s battery is integrated and cannot be removed, recharged, replaced, or used to power other devices.<br /><strong>4th:</strong>&nbsp;This functions as the 3rd-level junksword, but it deals 2d8 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it&rsquo;s an analog weapon or 3d4 damage if it&rsquo;s a powered weapon, and it gains the stunned critical effect (rather than staggered).<br /><strong>5th:</strong>&nbsp;This functions as the 3rd-level casting of junksword, but the junksword deals 3d10 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it&rsquo;s an analog weapon or 3d6 electricity damage if it&rsquo;s a powered weapon, and it gains the stunned critical effect (rather than staggered).<br /><strong>6th:</strong>&nbsp;This functions as the 3rd-level casting of junksword, but the junksword deals 6d6 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it&rsquo;s an analog weapon or 3d8 electricity damage if it&rsquo;s a powered weapon, and it gains the stunned critical effect (rather than staggered). Additionally, you can grant the junksword one of the following weapon fusions: dispelling, entangling, ghost killer, merciful, or spellthrower.</p>	null	6	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	2	null	10 minutes/level (D)	none	no	PWD	205

If successful,&nbsp;</span><em>knock</em><span>&nbsp;opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors (but doesn&rsquo;t identify secret doors you haven&rsquo;t found) as well as locked or trick-opening containers, starship doors, and similar secured entryways. It also loosens chains, shackles, or welds (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open a door closed with security seal, the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove the seal but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.&nbsp;</span><em>Knock&nbsp;</em><span>does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a force field barrier) or open any door or container larger than the spell&rsquo;s area, nor does it affect ropes, webs, and the like.</span></p>	null	2	2	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one door, container, or portal with an area of up to 10 sq. ft./level	instantaneous; see text	none	no	CRB	363

You must be able to identify the creature clearly from personal knowledge of who they are. If you and the creature you identify are not on the same planet-sized body, the spell fails. You can input the coordinates into any computer attached to an infosphere on the same planet to find general directions. If you use the Piloting skill&rsquo;s navigation task to reach the coordinates, these directions make your familiarity seldom visited (DC 15) even if the area would normally be unfamiliar.</span></p>	1	1	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	instantaneous	null	null	COM	137

This shell enables the targets to breathe freely in a variety of atmospheric conditions (including in corrosive, thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres), as well as underwater or in a vacuum. It also makes the targets immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons as well as spells with a harmful gaseous effect.

The creature can attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage, and spell resistance applies.

You can&rsquo;t target specific parts of a creature, and objects are not damaged by the spell.</span><br /><br /><span>You can target a single creature or several creatures, but each missile can strike only one creature.

Items with charges (such as batteries) and single-use items (such as potions and grenades) can&rsquo;t be repaired in this way.

The target can even have the broken condition. When you do so, you can cause the item to act as if you activated it without moving it from its space. If the target is a weapon, you can cause it to fire or activate for the rest of your turn. Then, you can make one attack against a creature in range using your ranged attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier or your melee attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier, whichever is applicable for the weapon you activate. If the target is a technological item with a usage entry, the item activates for the time listed in that usage entry.

If the target was in the middle of a task that requires longer than a single round to accomplish, it must begin again.

All of the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. A construct can benefit from this spell only once per day.

The spell can indicate an identical match, a categorical match, or no match. For instance, blood samples are identical if they are from the same creature. They are categorical if they are from the same species. No match exists if the blood samples are from different species or if one sample is stage blood.</span><br /><span>Alternatively, you can compare dissimilar items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you can compare a creature&rsquo;s tooth against a bite mark and know whether that creature could have caused the bite mark. This spell is fallible. An identical match can result from comparing items that are duplicates of one another. For instance, a knife might have an identical match with a stab wound if an identical knife was used to inflict the wound.

A creature that breathes in the miasma must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

The microbots begin in a 10-foot-square area when you create them, and you can create the cloud so that it shares the space of other creatures. If no creatures are within the cloud&rsquo;s area, the microbots pursue and harass the nearest creature that is hostile to you as best they can each round. Although the microbots generally know which creatures are your enemies, you have no control over their targets or direction of travel. If there are multiple valid targets the microbots can harass, the cloud will split into a maximum of four 5-foot-square segments and pursue different targets.</span><br /><br /><span>The cloud (and any segments thereof) has a fly speed of 20 feet. Each round on your turn, the microbot cloud grants harrying fire (see page 247) against the foes in its spaces. In addition, the cloud grants covering fire (see page 246) to anyone attacked by foes in its spaces. The microbots constantly repair themselves and the cloud generates new microbots every few seconds, so any attack against them is essentially ineffective.</span></p>	null	2	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	distracting cloud of microbots	null	3	null	concentration + 1 round	none	no	CRB	364

If it fails, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the answer you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds by 5 or more, it answers however it chooses and you believe that wrong answer to be the truth. Your questions are purely telepathic inquiries, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly into your mind.

You can maintain the swap at any range on the same plane. You can shift back to your body as a standard action, and doing so ends the spell. If your new body is killed, you return to your body and the target dies. If your body is killed, you can remain in the host&rsquo;s body for the duration or until it is killed. Then, you die if your body is still dead. However, if you recast this spell, you can reset the duration you remain in the target&rsquo;s body. You can cast this spell from a body that is not your own, swapping minds with a new target and resetting the spell&rsquo;s duration.

230	Mirror Image	<p>Create decoy duplicates of yourself.</p><p><span>This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.</span><br /><br /><span>When you cast&nbsp;</span><em>mirror image</em><span>, it creates 1d4 figment images. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack hits, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss, and an attack that misses you due to a miss chance also destroys an image. Area spells and effects that don&rsquo;t require an attack roll affect you normally and don&rsquo;t destroy any of your figments. Spells with a range of touch are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.</span><br /><br /><span>An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect. Blindsense doesn&rsquo;t help distinguish the figments from the real you, but blindsight is sufficient to do so.</span></p>	null	2	2	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 minute/level	null	null	CRB	366

The double appears within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don&rsquo;t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it can&rsquo;t attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.<br />The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires.

248	Nightmare	<p>Send a terrible nightmare to a distant target.</p><p>You precisely identify a target, such as by name or via a material connection like a personal possession or lock of its hair. The spell fails without expending a spell slot if the target isn&rsquo;t asleep or in a resting state similar to sleep. If you&rsquo;ve never met the target in person and lack a material connection to the target, the target gains a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the spell works, the target remains resting for 1 minute, then has a nightmare, rouses, and becomes frightened for 2d6 rounds. The target can&rsquo;t willingly reenter the affected resting state for 1 hour. To do so after this time has elapsed, the target must succeed at the saving throw again. If this save fails, the target can try again once per hour thereafter. After 24 hours have passed, this restless state ends.</p>	3	3	null	illusion (mind-affecting)	10 minutes	null	null	8	one living creature	instantaneous	Will negates	yes	SS1	52

Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.<br />While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they&rsquo;re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct (about the size of a small apple) with the magical subtype. They each have 1 Hit Point and EAC and KAC of 18, and they fly at a speed of 30 feet with a +20 bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly and a +16 bonus to Stealth checks. An eye has a +20 Perception bonus and is subject to darkness, fog, illusions, and any other factors that affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling in darkness must find its way by touch.<br />When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than 25 words. The eyes know anything you know.<br />In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each eye replays in your mind all that it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying all of its findings, an eye simply disappears.<br />If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won&rsquo;t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.<br />The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy the eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel.</p>	null	5	null	divination	1 minute	20 magical sensors	null	21	null	1 hour/level (D); see text	none	no	CRB	370

318	Rewire Flesh	<p>Turn target partially into a robot, dealing 3d6 damage per round and reducing speed.</p><p>Like rewriting the code that makes up a computer program, you manipulate the target&rsquo;s DNA to painfully rewire that target&rsquo;s biological functions to mimic the cold and rigid processes of a robot. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw, or all of its movement speeds are halved and it takes 3d6 slashing damage per round on its turn as its internal organs shift and transform to become more like the inner components of a robot. Each round, the target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to halve the damage this spell causes.<br />While this spell is in effect, the target&rsquo;s body becomes visibly more robotic; its voice is tinny and halting, its movements are jerky, and its face is unmoving and emotionless. The target has the flat-footed condition, and it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to all Sense Motive checks as well as to all Charisma-based and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks.</p>	null	4	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one living creature	1 round/level (D); see text	Will negates and Fortitude half, see text	yes	CRB	375

<p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination within 2,000 miles. Interplanar and interplanetary travel is not possible, and neither is travel between two moving starships during combat, though you might be able to teleport to a planet&rsquo;s surface from an orbiting starship. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum bulk limit. You can also bring up to five additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster, you need not attempt a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance.<br />You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult Table 10&ndash;1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br />Familiarity: &ldquo;Very familiar&rdquo; describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. &ldquo;Studied carefully&rdquo; describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you&rsquo;ve been there often. &ldquo;Seen casually&rdquo; describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. &ldquo;Viewed once&rdquo; describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can&rsquo;t teleport to an unknown location that you&rsquo;ve seen in a holovid).<br />&ldquo;False destination&rdquo; describes a place that doesn&rsquo;t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br />On Target: You appear where you want to be.<br />Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.<br />Similar Area: You wind up in an area that&rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell&rsquo;s range, the spell simply fails instead.<br />Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten &ldquo;scrambled.&rdquo; You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time &ldquo;mishap&rdquo; comes up, the creatures take more damage and must reroll.</p>	null	5	5	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	20	you and touched objects and other touched willing or unconscious creatures	instantaneous	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	CRB	381
377	Terraform	<p>Alter terrain and climate.</p><p><span>You alter the area&rsquo;s terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert into plains. To cast this spell, you must spend 10 Resolve Points along with technological gear worth 30,000 credits (which is magically augmented to do much of the terraforming, then consumed by the spell). A xenodruid mystic instead uses crystals and incenses worth 30,000 credits. This magically alters the area&rsquo;s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but it doesn&rsquo;t affect creatures or the configuration of the ground. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but it doesn&rsquo;t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.</span><br /><span>You can alter the climate by one step (cold, temperate, or warm). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general it changes to a similar terrain type or by one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on).</span><br /><span>Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas.</span></p>	null	6	6	transmutation	1 hour	null	100-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	18	null	1 day/level; see text	none	no	CRB	382
378	Token Spell	<p>Perform simple magical effects.</p><p><span>Token spells are often some of the first minor changes that spellcasters produce when they begin experimenting with magic. Once cast, token spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. You can slowly lift one item of light bulk. You can alter items in a 1-foot cube each round, coloring, cleaning, soiling, cooling, warming, or flavoring them. You can create small objects, but they look artificial and are extremely fragile (they can&rsquo;t be used as tools or weapons). You can illuminate an object to shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.</span><br /><span>Token spell lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists for only 1 hour.</span></p>	0	0	0	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	13	null	1 hour	none	yes	CRB	382

The target can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the target to speak with creatures who don&rsquo;t speak.

You can only transfer charges using two objects of the exact same type (two batteries of the same size, two identical power cells, or the like); you transfer charges from the source object to the receiving object.</span><br /><span>You must declare how many charges you are transferring before casting this spell. If you transfer more charges from the source than the receiving item can hold, the receiving item must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 electricity damage. This spell provides no knowledge of how many charges a receiving item can safely hold, but you can choose to transfer fewer charges than the maximum allowed to reduce the risk.</span></p>	null	0	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	two objects of the same type; see text	instantaneous	Fortitude negates (object)	yes (object)	CRB	383
381	Transfer Consciousness	<p>Transfer your mind into a computer or willing technological construct, and control its functions.</p><p>You transfer your mind into a computer or technological construct. If you transfer your mind into a computer, its tier can be no higher than half your caster level. If you transfer into a construct, it must be willing or, if nonsapient, not hostile to you. The construct&rsquo;s CR or level can be no higher than your caster level.<br />While your mind is in a computer system, you have direct control over its commands. You can perform Computers checks related to that system in half the usual time.<br />If you transfer your mind into a technological construct, you have access to its functions, allowing you to control the creature directly. You can&rsquo;t cast the construct&rsquo;s spells or use its spell-like or supernatural abilities. You can cast your own spells.<br />While this spell lasts, your body falls prone and helpless, as if you were unconscious. When the spell ends, your mind transfers back to your body instantly, provided your body and the target are on the same plane.

This spell must be cast on a vehicle able to carry more than one passenger, or the spell fails. The extradimensional space appears in the vehicle&rsquo;s seating area or the starship&rsquo;s bridge or passenger section, and it looks like a thin, glowing gap in reality. Creatures that step through this gap are shunted into the extradimensional space, which appears to be and functions as another compartment in the vehicle. A creature can exit the extradimensional space as part of a move action to move through the gap in reality, though a creature cannot exit the extradimensional space unless room to accommodate it exists in the normal seating area.<br />Creatures that are encumbered or overburdened cannot enter the extradimensional space. If a creature is larger than Medium, each size category counts as one additional creature for determining the capacity of the extradimensional space.<br />Creatures within the extradimensional space can&rsquo;t interact with anything outside the vehicle, nor can creatures outside the vehicle perceive or interact with occupants and contents of the space. If the vehicle is destroyed or the extradimensional space is dispelled, the extradimensional space collapses. Anything within the extradimensional space when the vehicle or starship is destroyed, the space is dispelled, or this spell ends are shunted to the nearest open spaces outside the target.</p>	null	4	null	transmutation	1 minute	null	null	2	one vehicle or Tiny starship; see text	1 hour/level	none (object)	no (object)	COM	142
383	True Seeing	<p>Target can see things as they really are.</p><p><span>You confer upon the target the ability to see all things within 120 feet as they actually are. The target sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects that are invisible or displaced, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of changed or transmuted things. Further, the target can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces).</span><br /><span>True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means.</span></p>	6	6	6	divination	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	1 minute/level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	383
384	Umbral Tendrils	<p>Assault a group of creatures with shadowy tentacles.</p><p>You summon a vision of a writhing mass of shadowy tendrils to assault creatures within 10 feet of the ground in the area. This area is difficul terrain. The first time a creature enters the area (including when the effect appears) on its turn, and each round the creature remains there, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and becomes entangled. If the tendrils are in dim light or darkness, the DC of the Will save increases by 2. A creature that succeeds at a Will saving throw halves the damage it takes and avoids becoming entangled. The same casting of this spell can&rsquo;t render such a creature entangled again. By succeeding at subsequent saves, such a creature reduces damage it takes from the same casting of the spell to one-quarter normal.</p>	3	null	null	illusion (shadow)	1 standard action	null	20-ft.-radius spread	4	null	1 round + 1 round/3 levels (D)	Will half, see text	yes	SS3	53
385	Unseen Servant	<p>Invisible force obeys your commands.</p><p><span>The spell conjures an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command (a move action). It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift up to 20 pounds or 2 bulk or drag up to 100 pounds or 10 bulk). It can trigger traps and such, but it can&rsquo;t exert enough force to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can&rsquo;t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can&rsquo;t be used untrained. This servant can&rsquo;t fly, climb, or swim (though it can walk on water). Its land speed is 15 feet.</span><br /><span>The servant can&rsquo;t attack in any way; it is never allowed to make attack rolls. It can&rsquo;t be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 or more damage from area attacks; it gets no saving throws against attacks.</span></p>	null	1	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	one invisible, mindless, shapeless servant	null	3	null	1 hour/level	none	no	CRB	383

A foe in the area takes 4d6 damage per round and cannot move until it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw, which it can attempt at the end of each of its turns. At that point, the opponent can be affected again only if it leaves the spell&rsquo;s area and then returns.<br />A creature that takes damage from this spell 3 rounds in a row must succeed at a Fortitude save or be consumed by the unspeakable presences. That creature dies, and when the spell ends, its body and gear disappear into the realities from whence the presences came. This is a death effect. Only miracle, warp reality, and wish can bring back a creature slain this way.</p>	null	null	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	60-ft. radius	5	null	1 round/level (D)	none; see text	no	COM	142
387	Unwilling Guardian	<p>Charm a target into protecting you during combat.</p><p><span>Your overwhelming presence bores into the target&rsquo;s mind, cowing its will. This turns it into an automaton-like guardian that protects you at all costs. As soon as it is able, the target mindlessly moves along the most direct route toward you and stops when it is within 10 feet of you (provoking attacks of opportunity for movement as normal). If you are being attacked in melee by a creature within 10 feet, the target instead takes the quickest route to intercept that creature from a square within 10 feet of you and attack it on your behalf.</span><br /><span>While this spell is in effect, the target attacks any creature that attacks you in melee, though it can&rsquo;t move more than 10 feet from you to do so. If multiple creatures are attacking you in melee, you can choose which creature the target attacks on your behalf as part of combat banter. If you are the target of ranged attacks and your guardian is not attacking a melee assailant on your behalf, it moves to provide cover against the ranged attacks. Due to the strong momentary connection between you and your unwilling guardian, if you are the single target of a hostile creature&rsquo;s spell or effect, the creature must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 6 + your caster level) or the spell or effect instead targets your guardian. This spell has no effect on area of effect or multi-target spells or other effects that include you as a target.</span><br /><span>When this spell ends, the target regains control of its faculties entirely and it knows and remembers that you used magic to control it. Once a creature has been the target of unwilling guardian, it can&rsquo;t be targeted with this spell again for 24 hours if cast by the same spellcaster.</span></p>	null	5	5	enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	3	one creature with CR lower than your level; see text	1 round/level (D)	Will negates	yes	CRB	383

When the spell first takes effect, illusory hellfire crashes to the ground, dealing 6d6 fire damage to your enemies in the area. Creatures can attempt a Will saving throw to disbelieve the fiery vision and take only half damage.<br />Then, for the duration, two more effects continue. An illusion makes the ground appear to be unstable crust over lava, which your foes treat as difficult terrain. Grasping hands appear to reach out from the ground to grab at enemies. Each time an enemy starts its turn in the area, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be unable to leave its space for the turn.</p>	null	null	6	illusion (shadow)	1 standard action	null	60-ft. radius	5	null	1 round/level (D)	Will disbelief and Reflex partial; see text	yes	COM	142

You can make the targets appear to be anything you wish. The targets look, feel, and smell just like what the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures return to their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed at a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus to such a check (since it counts as altering your form).</span><br /><span>An unwilling target can negate the spell&rsquo;s effect on it by succeeding at a Will saving throw or by relying on spell resistance. Those who interact with the targets can attempt Will saving throws to disbelieve the illusion, but spell resistance doesn&rsquo;t help pierce the illusion.</span></p>	null	6	6	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	5	up to one or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	concentration + 1 hour/level (D)	Will negates or disbelief, see text	yes, see text	CRB	384

391	Verdant Code		<p>You turn data into plant matter that either instantly explodes outward or lurks within a device.<br /><strong>Instant Growth:</strong>&nbsp;You immediately incite growth from the targeted device. A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.<br />For both this and the dormant growth effect (see below), the plant matter explodes from the targeted device, filling all squares within a 20-foot-radius spread. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 slashing damage and is entangled; on a successful save, it takes half damage, isn&rsquo;t entangled, and is shunted to the nearest empty space available. A square of plant matter has hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. The growth also covers the device, preventing non-remote access until the plant matter is destroyed or disintegrates at the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration.<br /><strong>Dormant Growth:</strong>&nbsp;You implant verdant code into an computer system or module you have root access to. The next time the device is accessed, plant matter explodes from the device (see above). A device can hold only one instance of verdant code at a time, and new instances erase the previous instance. If this spell&rsquo;s duration ends before the implanted code is accessed, the code vanishes. This code can be made permanent, as implant data.</p>	null	1	1	conjuration	1 standard action	null	null	3	one computer system or module	1 hour/level or until triggered, then 1 minute/level, see text	Will negates (object), Reflex partial, see text	yes (object), see text	NSP	129
392	Vigilant Junkbot	<p>Create a temporary robot made of junk that can protect you from ranged or melee attacks.</p><p>You turn the target into a robot that can guard you. This spell works like handy junkbot insofar as targeting parameters and your inability to target the same equipment after the spell ends. The junkbot you create is Tiny and appears in your space.<br />A vigilant junkbot can take no actions. Instead, you instruct the junkbot to perform its melee protocol or ranged protocol. You can change the protocol telepathically as a move action. In its melee protocol, the junkbot attaches to you, granting you a +1 bonus to KAC for every 4 technomancer levels you have. In its ranged protocol, the vigilant junkbot hovers at strategic angles to cover you, granting you concealment against ranged attacks. Additionally, when you take damage from an attack that matches the protocol (melee or ranged), the junkbot takes the first 3 damage. Any additional damage passes to you.<br />Enemies can target the junkbot instead of you. Its KAC and EAC are each 10 + your caster level, and it has Hit Points equal to one-quarter of your own (but no Stamina Points). The junkbot uses your saving throw bonuses, and it is a construct with the magical and technological subtypes.</p>	null	2	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text	1 round/level	none	no	COM	143
393	Viral Destruction	<p>Create a virus in a recently dead body, allowing it to strike again and potentially spread the virus further.</p><p><span>You can cast this spell only immediately after a creature in range dies. On its next turn in the initiative order, the corpse stands up (if applicable; this does not require a move action), can take a single move action to move up to its speed, and makes a single attack using the weapons and bonuses it had when alive (though it can&rsquo;t use class features, spell-like abilities, or spells). You can choose the target of the affected creature&rsquo;s attack or allow the target corpse to select a target entirely at random. If the target of this spell was friendly or helpful toward you in life, the spell works automatically; otherwise, the corpse can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this spell, as if the creature were still alive.</span><br /><span>After making its attack, the creature that you have targeted with viral destruction falls and is dead as normal. However, if this attack kills the affected creature&rsquo;s target or if it knocks it unconscious, that target must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the spell&rsquo;s DC) or be subject to viral destruction and make a single attack on its next turn before returning to its normal dead or unconscious state. If the secondary target of viral destruction is merely unconscious and becomes conscious again before its next action, that creature is freed from the viral destruction effect and the spell ends. Each attack caused by this spell can transfer the viral destruction effect to its target if that target is knocked unconscious or killed by the attack, until the spell has affected a number of creatures equal to your mystic level.</span></p>	3	null	null	necromancy	1 reaction	null	null	3	one newly dead creature; see text	instantaneous; see text	Will negates, see text	yes	DS02	51
394	Vision	<p>Answer a question about a person, place, or object.</p><p><span>You pose a question about some person, place, or object while casting this spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question and you succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, DC 20), you receive a vision about that person, place, or object. The information gained includes everything available about the target that could be discovered by spending weeks in dedicated research with excellent-quality but standard reference works.</span><br /><span>If the person or object is not at hand or you are not in the place and you know only detailed information about the person, place, or object, the DC of the caster level check is 25 and the information gained is incomplete (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better vision result next time). If you know only rumors, the DC is 30 and the information gained is vague (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better vision result next time). In most circumstances, you can&rsquo;t glean information about what occurred during the Gap with this spell.</span><br /><span>Casting this spell requires access to a computer or similar device, which displays the information gained.

One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet.

The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.</span><br /><span>If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.

396	Wall of Force	<p>Invisible wall is difficult to destroy.</p><p><span>Wall of force creates an invisible wall of pure force. You can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.</span><br /><span>This counts as a force field for effects that can&rsquo;t penetrate a force field. The wall can&rsquo;t move and is not easily destroyed. A wall of force is immune to dispel magic. A greater dispel magic specifically targeting the wall of force can dispel it, but treat the wall of force&rsquo;s caster level as being 5 higher than the actual caster level. A wall of force can be damaged by spells and attacks as normal, but a wall of force has hardness 30 and 300 Hit Points. Disintegrate instantly destroys a wall of force.</span><br /><span>Breath weapons and spells can&rsquo;t pass through a wall of force in either direction, though dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier.
