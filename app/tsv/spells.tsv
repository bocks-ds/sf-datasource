1	Acid Rain	<p>A storm deals 3d6 damage for 1 round per level, imposes a 50% miss chance, and staggers enemies at its end.</p>	<p>You pull a downpour of elemental precipitation from an alternate reality. You then direct this acid rain to pour only onto your enemies, dealing them 3d6 acid damage each round. The acid splashes into and burns your foes&rsquo; eyes, coats them in slime, and clouds their other senses. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save when exposed to the spell. On a failure, the creature has a 50% miss chance for its attacks while in the area. The rain causes spellcasters who fail the save to have a 20% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast from within the area. When this spell ends, a thunderclap causes enemies still in the area who failed their Fortitude saves to be staggered for 1 round.<br />As a standard action, you can change the rain, causing it to deal a different type of energy damage, such as fiery sparks that deal fire damage or shards of ice that deal cold damage. This change in damage types leaves secondary effects unchanged. When the spell ends, the rain leaves no aftereffects.</p>	null	null	5	evocation	1 standard action	null	cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)	5	null	1 round/level (D)	Fortitude partial (see text)	no	COM	133

Your tier 0 or better computer (such as a comm unit) instantly compiles snippets and selections from various media relevant to the subject. The information remains for 2 minutes, during which you explore it. Once you&rsquo;re finished, you can attempt one skill check to recall knowledge on the topic with a +4 divine bonus, and you can do so untrained if the DC is 20 or lower. On a failed skill check, the GM can select some small insight into the topic that you retain. All the information you downloaded from this spell then disappears back to the Akashic Record. Using this spell doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from doing further research using a downloaded data set or library chip, but perusing this magical download can&rsquo;t be done concurrently with such study.</p>	1	1	1	divination	1 round	null	null	1	null	2 minutes (see text)	null	null	A!05	50
4	Akashic Revival	<p>You create perfect documentation of your physical body in the Akashic Record at the time the spell is cast, allowing you to later recall this record and reconstruct your body as it was when you cast this spell.</p>	<p>You create perfect documentation of your physical body in the Akashic Record at the time the spell is cast, allowing you to later recall this record and reconstruct your body as it was when you cast this spell. The record of your body includes your current Stamina Points, Hit Points, augmentations, physical ability scores, and any enduring negative physical states (including ability damage or drain to physical ability scores, disease, negative levels, poison, and so on). Any effect that was affecting you when you cast this spell to store your record continues with its normal duration, so that effect might expire between the time you store your record and when you later recall it.</p><p>To recall your record, either you must die due to events other than old age or, if you are at 0 Hit Points, you can instead allow your body to perish by spending 3 Resolve Points. If either of these things occurs, you can claim your record as your new physical body at the start of your next turn. Your corpse disappears. Then, you instantly reappear, standing in your recorded body in the corpse&rsquo;s space and wearing your gear. If you cannot appear in that space, you appear as close to it as you can. You retain your mind as it was at the time of your body&rsquo;s death, so you regain no expended spells, Resolve Points, or uses of special abilities. Any mental effects affecting you or mental ability damage present at the time of your death persist in your new body.</p><p>Casting this spell again replaces any previous record of yourself with a new one&mdash;you can store only one copy of yourself in the Akashic Record.</p>	6	null	6	necromancy	1 hour	null	null	1	null	24 hours	null	null	A!05	50
5	Alter Corpse	<p>You cause a corpse to change to suit a narrative you choose.</p>	<p>You cause a corpse to change to suit a narrative you choose. This spell can hide or create clues about how the corpse ended up in its current state, from closing wounds to evaporating chemicals in the cadaver&rsquo;s system. However, the changes cannot be major, such as removing or restoring a limb, or stripping flesh from the skeleton. The spell is also unable to change the corpse&rsquo;s identity.<br />Anyone who examines the corpse can attempt a Perception check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to notice that the corpse&rsquo;s condition (or lack thereof) seems manipulated, but success doesn&rsquo;t allow the observer to determine what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast. Closely examining the corpse with a successful Medicine check (DC = 15 + your caster level) not only reveals what a successful Perception check does, but also reveals what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast.</p>	2	null	2	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	2	one corpse	instantaneous	none	no	3C01	45
6	Animate Armor	<p>Briefly control a suit of armor</p>	<p>You temporarily infuse a suit of armor with a magic force that allows it to move on its own and that directs its mechanisms. When you cast this spell, the armor acts and responds to your mental control for as long as you concentrate. Each round on your turn, the armor can perform either a move action or a standard action to attack. The armor can move up to 30 feet (or its listed speed using any of its available modes of movement, if powered armor or containing an armor upgrade that alters movement). When the armor attacks, it can either make an unarmed attack, dealing 4d8 + your caster level bludgeoning damage (or the listed damage plus its Strength modifier, for powered armor) or make an attack with any of the weapons mounted in its weapon slots or weapons with the integrated special property installed in its upgrade slots (if any); this deals the weapon&rsquo;s base damage for ranged attacks and the weapon&rsquo;s base damage plus the armor&rsquo;s Strength modifier for melee attacks. The armor has a bonus to attacks equal to 6 + your caster level. If the armor has no listed Strength score, it can apply a Strength bonus equal to your caster level.</p><p>Should the animated armor be attacked, its EAC and KAC are equal to 10 + the EAC and KAC bonus the armor provides. It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects, and it has the typical hardness and Hit Points for an item of its level. For the purpose of spells and effects that target the armor, it is treated as a construct with the technological and magical subtypes while the spell lasts.</p><p>This spell has no effect if cast on powered armor with a depleted battery or powered armor of an item level that exceeds your caster level.</p>	null	5	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	one unattended suit of armor	concentration, up to 1 round/level	none	no	ARM	156
7	Animate Dead	<p>Create controlled undead creatures out of target corpses.</p>	<p>This spell turns corpses into undead creatures that obey your spoken commands. The undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in place and attack any creature (or a specific kind of creature) entering the area. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed undead can&rsquo;t be animated again.</p><p>You can create one or more undead creatures with a total CR of no more than half your caster level. You can only create one type of undead with each casting of this spell. Creating undead requires special materials worth 1,000 credits &times; the total CR of the undead created; these materials are consumed as part of casting the spell.</p><p>The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only a number of undead whose total CR is no greater than your caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Once released, such undead have no particular feelings of loyalty to you, and in time they may grow in power beyond the undead you can create.</p><p>The corpses you use must be as intact as the typical undead of the type you choose to create. For example, a skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse (that has bones) or skeleton. A zombie can be created only from a creature with a physical anatomy.</p>	4	4	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	2	one or more corpses	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	340
8	Antiradiation	<p>Calm an area of radiation, the strength of which depends on your caster level.</p>	<p>You permeate radiation with mitigations from other realities, dissipating radiation effects in the spell&rsquo;s area; the radiation level you affect depends on your caster level, as shown on the table below. Once radiation has been dissipated, the environment in the area has no harmful effects from radiation, although this spell does not remove ongoing radiation-creating effects.<br />An&nbsp;<em>antiradiation</em>&nbsp;spell counters an&nbsp;<em>irradiate spell</em>, as long as your caster level is greater than the caster level of the creature or effect that created the&nbsp;<em>irradiate</em>&nbsp;effect.</p><table class="inner ds-table"><tbody><tr><td>CASTER LEVEL</td><td>RADIATION LEVEL</td></tr><tr><td>6th or lower</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>7th&ndash;9th</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>10th&ndash;16th</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>17th or higher</td><td>Severe</td></tr></tbody></table>	null	null	3	abjuration	1 standard action	null	10-ft.-radius spread; see text	4	null	instantaneous	null	null	COM	133
9	Arcane Eye	<p>Invisible floating eye moves 30 feet per round and sends you visual information.</p>	<p>You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. The sensor appears at any point within line of sight, but it can then travel beyond your line of sight without hindrance. An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a humanoid would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The arcane eye sees exactly as you would see if you were there.</p><p>The arcane eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The arcane eye can&rsquo;t enter another plane of existence, even through Drift travel or a magical gate or similar magical portal.</p><p>You must concentrate to use an arcane eye. If you do not concentrate, the sensor is inert until you concentrate again.</p>	null	4	null	divination (scrying)	10 minutes	magical sensor	null	6	null	1 minute/level (D)	none	no	CRB	340
10	Arcane Sight	<p>Magical sources become visible to you.</p>	<p>This spell allows you to see magic sources within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns information more quickly.</p><p>You know the location and caster level of all magic sources within your sight. If the magic sources are in line of sight, you can attempt a DC 28 Mysticism check (one check per source) to determine the school of magic involved in each source.</p><p>If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities and the caster level of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.</p><p>As with detect magic, you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not of artifacts.</p>	null	3	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 minute/level (D)	null	null	CRB	340

12	Augury	<p>Learn whether an action will be good or bad.</p>	<p>Casting&nbsp;<em>augury&nbsp;</em>can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. Casting this spell takes intense personal focus and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point.<br /><br />The chance for successfully receiving a meaningful reply is 75%; this roll is made secretly by the GM. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or it may be so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results.</p><ul><li>Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</li><li>Woe (for bad results).</li><li>Weal and woe (for both).</li><li>Nothing (for actions that have neither especially good nor especially bad results).</li></ul><p>If the augury isn&rsquo;t successful, you get the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result. A spellcaster who gets the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury.<br /><br />The augury can see only about 30 minutes into the future, so anything that might happen beyond that time frame does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. Multiple castings of&nbsp;<em>augury</em>&nbsp;by the same creature about the same topic use the same die result as the first casting.</p>	2	null	2	divination	1 minute	null	null	1	null	instantaneous	null	null	CRB	340
13	Awaken Computer	<p>Turn a computer into a friendly AI that you and up to four other creatures are authorized to use.</p>	<p>You infuse a computer with a spark of advanced technology, granting it an artificial personality. For this spell to take effect, you must have access to the computer, through either hacking it and bypassing any countermeasures it has or having unsecured access, but you don&rsquo;t need root access. Further, if the target computer&rsquo;s tier is equal to half your caster level or higher, you must expend credits equal to 5% of its base price while you cast this spell or the spell has no effect. This spell has no effect on computers that already have an artificial personality upgrade.</p><p>You decide the details of the computer&rsquo;s personality when you cast this spell, including its name, mannerisms, and sense of humor. The artificial personality recognizes you as its creator unless you remove that detail from its memory while casting. You can designate yourself and up to four other creatures as authorized users of the personality. This spell configures the personality with cunning and charm, granting it a bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks equal to 3 &times; its tier.</p>	null	4	null	transmutation	10 minutes	null	null	2	one computer	instantaneous	no (object)	no (object)	COM	133

Lesser remove condition and similar spells can end this effect.<br /><strong>2nd:</strong>&nbsp;As per the 1st-level version, but the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty and must attempt an additional saving throw each round until it fails or the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.

23	Battle Junkbot	<p>Create a temporary robot from random junk, turning it into a deadly combatant.</p>	<p>You turn a pile of technological junk into a vicious robot that can hunt down and attack your enemies.</p><p>You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above as long as the junk is found in a large enough quantity. Creating a battle junkbot also requires one ultra-capacity battery. Casting this spell drains all of the battery&rsquo;s charges.</p><p>While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with aggression and martial skills. A battle junkbot is Small, its KAC and EAC are each equal to 15 + your technomancer level, it has hardness 15, and it has a number of Hit Points equal to half of your own (but no Stamina Points). It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects. It has a land speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet with average maneuverability. For purposes of spells and effects that target the junkbot, it is treated as a construct with the magical and technological subtypes.</p><p>The battle junkbot has four hands. It is treated as if it had the Deadly Aim and Improved Combat Maneuver (Bull Rush, Grapple, Trip) feats. It has an attack bonus equal to 6 + your technomancer level; in one hand it wields a special buzzblade dagger that deals 6d8+6 damage instead of its normal damage, and a second hand carries a special light laser pistol that deals 6d6 damage instead of its normal damage. Damage from the junkbot&rsquo;s special weapons counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>You can give new basic commands to your battle junkbot telepathically on your turn as a move action, and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature. You are aware when the robot has made an attack or combat maneuver and whether or not it was successful, as well as when the battle junkbot has been attacked, has taken damage, or is destroyed, but you can perceive nothing else through this basic telepathic link.</p><p>When the battle junkbot is destroyed or this spell ends, the electronic equipment you used to create the junkbot falls apart into refuse, its circuitry fried beyond anything recognizable. You cannot use this refuse as a target to create another junkbot.</p>	null	6	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	at least 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text	1 round/level	none	no	CRB	341
24	Battlemind Link	<p>Creates a psychic link that gives a bonus to initiative and other benefits.</p>	<p>You create a strong temporary psychic link between two creatures that allows them to act almost as one. This spell works like lesser battlemind link, but the enhancement bonus to initiative rolls is +4, and the spell ends if the targets are more than 500 feet apart, rather than 200 feet apart. In addition, if the targets threaten the same enemy, they are considered to be flanking that foe regardless of their actual positions. When one of the targets hits a foe with a ranged attack, they can, as a reaction, apply the effects of covering fire or harrying fire against that foe for the other target of this spell. Finally, each target gains a +4 enhancement bonus to attacks of opportunity if they both attack the same creature due to the same triggering action on that creature&rsquo;s part.</p>	5	null	null	divination (mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	17	null	10 minutes/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	A!02	45

This spells also grants each target a +2 enhancement bonus to initiative rolls.

Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li>The target takes a &ndash;4 penalty to ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.</li><li>Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.</li></ul><p>You can also invent your own curse (see Afflictions on page 414 for a few ideas), but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a&nbsp;<em>break enchantment</em>,&nbsp;<em>miracle</em>,&nbsp;<em>remove affliction</em>, or&nbsp;<em>wish</em>&nbsp;spell.<br /><br />Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.&nbsp;<em>Bestow curse</em>&nbsp;counters&nbsp;<em>remove affliction</em>.</p>	3	null	null	necromancy (curse)	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	permanent	Will negates	yes	CRB	341
27	Bilocation	<p>The spell creates an identical copy of you in an adjacent space, along with everything you wear and carry other than artifacts.</p>	<p>The spell creates an identical copy of you in an adjacent space, along with everything you wear and carry other than artifacts. (If you carry an artifact, you decide which body retains it.) You exist in two places at once until the spell ends. Once the copy is created, it can travel an unlimited distance away from you. Your duplicate acts just after you do each round&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t have a separate initiative count. One of you can use a full round&rsquo;s worth of actions, and the other can take only a standard or a move action. Between the two of you, you can cast only one spell per round&mdash;unless you have a special ability that allows you to cast more than one spell when you have no duplicate, such as the quickened spell magic hack. You and your duplicate share sensory information, so if one of you is aware of or knows something, both of you do. The duplicate is another creature for most purposes, with the following exceptions.</p><p>You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share resources, including one pool of consumable items (including ammo), daily-use abilities (including from items) and spell slots, Hit Points, Resolve Points, and Stamina Points. If your duplicate casts a spell, your spell is expended, and if your duplicate uses a consumable item, that item is no longer available to you. Similarly, if an item one of you carries is permanently lost or destroyed, that item is lost or destroyed for both. Attacks, spells, and effects affect the two bodies as though they were one person, taking the worst effect applicable. For example, if both bodies are in the same explosive blast, you attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If you fail the saving throw against hold person, both bodies are paralyzed, and if one body catches a disease, both do. Both bodies count as one creature for spell effects, and they can&rsquo;t be chosen more than once for such effects. Any magical effect on you has its duration halved while you&rsquo;re bilocating. For example, the aforementioned hold person loses 2 rounds of duration each round it paralyzes you and your duplicate. Similarly, if you cast resistant armor on yourself, your duplicate is also affected, and the spell has a duration of 5 minutes per level. An effect that has its duration shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round.</p><p>In addition, if you attempt a skill check to recall knowledge, you roll only one check. Similarly, if you and your duplicate are in the same area, you roll only one Perception check to determine what you&rsquo;re both aware of, although you receive a +2 bonus to this check as if your duplicate aided you on it.</p><p>When this spell ends, you decide which body remains and which disappears. Any enduring effects continue to affect you.</p>	null	6	6	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 round/level (D)	null	null	A!05	51
28	Biotic Shroud	<p>Create a shroud that protects against attacks and lets you fly.</p>	<p>You conjure forth a mantle of organic, insectile nanites that encircle you. The density of the swarm provides you with partial concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 piercing damage, although you can allow anyone to touch you without them taking damage, for instance to deliver a beneficial touch spell. As a move action, you cause the nanites to cling tightly to you, granting you a fly speed of 20 feet with clumsy maneuverability as an extraordinary ability. When using the shroud to fly, you have no concealment due to it, and it cannot harm creatures that successfully attack you in melee. You can return the nanites to their protective configuration as a move action.</p>	null	4	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 round/level (D)	null	null	A!02	45

In addition, when you dismiss the spell as a reaction when striking a target, that target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take the weapon's damage again and become nauseated for 1d3+1 rounds.</p>	null	4	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	living taclash	null	11	null	1 round/level (D); see text	null	null	A!02	45

The created weapon functions as a standard taclash with the living weapon special property. You are considered to be proficient with this taclash, and you add 1-1/2 times your caster level to damage rolls with it in place of your Weapon Specialization bonus. In addition, the weapon has the nauseate critical hit effect.</p><p>The biotic taclash functions only for you, and once you create it, you can neither drop it nor be disarmed of it. As a move action, you can stow the biotic taclash, causing its component nanites to discorporate into individual nanobots that disperse over your body but remain while the spell lasts. During that time, you can cause the nanites to reincorporate to form the weapon again by taking another move action.</p><p>As a reaction when you strike a target with the biotic taclash, you can dismiss the spell to cause the weapon to discorporate into its component nanites, which then swarm over the target.

If the door would not completely block the targeted hallway, you can&rsquo;t cast this spell. Any creature in the spaces where the door appears is harmlessly shunted to a side of the door you choose. The door&rsquo;s statistics are those of a starship interior wall. It is airtight, and it protects against vacuum and radiation. When the spell ends, the door vanishes without a trace.</p>	null	3	null	conjuration (creation)	1 round	wall up to 20 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 5 feet thick	null	3	null	1 round/level (D)	none	no	COM	133

If a gift you gain has limited uses, you can use the gift only by expending 1 Resolve Point for each use.</p>	4	4	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	null	1 round/level (D)	none	no	SS3	53
33	Break Enchantment	<p>Free creatures from curses, enchantments, and transmutations.</p>	<p>This spell frees victims from curses, enchantments, and transmutations. Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +15) against a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC of the caster level check is equal to the DC of the curse.</p><p>If the spell is one that can&rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, break enchantment doesn&rsquo;t remove the curse from the item but it does free the victim from the item&rsquo;s effects.</p>	5	5	5	abjuration	1 minute	null	null	3	up to one creature per level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	341

In addition, when you fail a Charisma check or Charisma-based skill check when interacting with the target, you can reroll the check as a reaction. However, if you attempt the reroll, the target receives a new saving throw against the spell.

The cloud obscures all sight, including darkvision beyond 5 feet. The area counts as a smoke hazard, except a creature within the cloud has total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can&rsquo;t use sight to locate the target) against their attackers. In addition, the embers within the cloud deal 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures ending their turns within the cloud.<br />A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong wing (21+ mph) or stronger disperses the cloud in 1 round.

36	Call Cosmos	<p>Rain cosmic particles on targets, dealing 4d6 fire damage and 3d6 cold damage.</p>	<p>You evoke a vertical column of dangerous material from across the universe that rains down upon creatures in the area. This matter is made up of bits of burning stars and chunks of frozen comets, and it deals 4d6 fire damage and 3d6 cold damage to every creature in the area. This damage occurs only once, when the spell is cast. For the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration, the fallen starstuff makes the entire area difficult terrain, and thick, swirling clouds of particulate space matter magically block vision. This obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision and other vision-based senses (including vision-based blindsight and sense through), but doesn&rsquo;t prevent blindsense. A creature within 5 feet of its attacker has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can&rsquo;t use sight to locate the target). Additionally, the swirling cosmic particles are distracting to spellcasters in the area, who have a 20% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast in the area. At the end of the duration, the starstuff disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).</p>	5	null	null	evocation	1 standard action	null	cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)	5	null	1 round/level (D)	none	yes	CRB	342

It is unlikely to attempt to harm you, but it is also unlikely to attack any of its true friends or allies. You can try to give the target suggestions, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries of this check are not allowed.)

Additionally, a creature affected by this spell can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in only 10 minutes.

46	Command Undead	<p>Undead creature obeys your commands.</p>	<p>This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature. If the target is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can give the target suggestions, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.</p><p>An unintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; and so on. Unintelligent undead won&rsquo;t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.</p><p>Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell. You command the undead creature by voice and it understands you, no matter what language you speak.</p>	2	2	null	necromancy (sense-dependent)	1 standard action	null	null	3	one undead creature	1 day/level	Will negates, see text	yes	CRB	343

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of native creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or general state of the natural setting.</p><p>In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings&mdash;caves, caverns, and the like&mdash;the spell is less powerful and its radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level.

The insight you gain might help you greet someone properly, know whether physical contact (a handshake, for example) is appropriate, or how to eat without making a mess or insulting your host. In addition, when you attempt Diplomacy checks to change attitudes during the duration, you can lower the DC by 5.

The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it. You can&rsquo;t use this spell to read magic writing or encoded messages (though it does reveal if a message is magic or encoded), but you can use it to read raw computer code or foreign programming languages, allowing you to understand enough to attempt Computers checks on those materials without penalties.</p>	null	1	1	divination	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	10 minutes/level	null	null	CRB	344
52	Confusion	<p>Targets behave randomly for 1 round per level.</p>	<p>This spell causes confusion in all creatures in the area, making them unable to determine their actions. Any confused creature that is attacked automatically attacks or attempts to attack its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused at the start of its next turn. Note that a confused creature will not make attacks of opportunity against any foe that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). For confused creatures that have not been attacked, roll on the following table at the start of each affected creature&rsquo;s turn each round to see what it does in that round.<br /><br /></p><table class="inner"><tbody><tr><td><strong>D%</strong></td><td><strong>Behavior</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1&ndash;25</td><td>Act normally.</td></tr><tr><td>26&ndash;50</td><td>Do nothing but babble incoherently.</td></tr><tr><td>51&ndash;75</td><td>Deal 1d8 + Str modifier damage to self with item in hand.</td></tr><tr><td>76&ndash;100</td><td>Attack nearest creature.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br />A confused creature that can&rsquo;t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.

54	Contact Other Plane	<p>Ask questions of an extraplanar entity, with questionable results.</p>	<p>You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane further removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; &ldquo;Irrelevant,&rdquo; or some other one-word answer.<br />You must concentrate on maintaining the spell in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You can ask one question for every 2 caster levels. On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. Contacting a minor planar power is relatively safe but may not result in useful answers. For each question you ask, the GM secretly rolls 1d20.<br />1&ndash;2: The power gives you no answer, the spell ends, and you must attempt a DC 7 Intelligence check. On a failed check, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for a week and you are unable to cast spells for that period.<br />3&ndash;5: You receive a random answer to the question.<br />6&ndash;10: You receive an incorrect answer to the question. Based on the nature and needs of the creature contacted, this may be a lie designed to harm you.<br />11&ndash;15: You receive no answer to the question.<br />16 or More: You receive a truthful and useful one-word answer. If the question can&rsquo;t be truthfully answered in this way, no answer is received.<br />Contact with minds further removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed by the power&rsquo;s sheer strangeness and force, but it also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. You can add any value from +1 to +5 to the d20 roll to represent contacting increasingly powerful planar beings. However, on a roll of 1 or 2, the result is still no answer, the spell ends, and you must attempt an Intelligence check to avoid losing Intelligence and Charisma. The DC of this Intelligence check is increased by the same amount added to the d20 check to contact a planar creature.</p>	5	5	5	divination	10 minutes	null	null	1	null	concentration	null	null	CRB	344
55	Control Atmosphere	<p>Alter the corrosiveness, density, or toxicity of the surrounding atmosphere.</p>	<p>You can alter the atmosphere within the spell&rsquo;s area to cause it to become more like the atmosphere of another planet. You can alter one aspect of the atmosphere&mdash;its corrosiveness, density, or toxicity. The possible effects of each of these changes are detailed below.</p><p>Corrosiveness: You can make the atmosphere corrosive. Each creature and object in the area when you cast the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 5d6 acid damage. Creatures and objects that remain in the area take 3d6 additional acid damage every 10 minutes (Fortitude half).</p><p>Alternatively, you can make a normally corrosive atmosphere noncorrosive. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell&rsquo;s area deals no acid damage for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Density: You can make the atmosphere in the area one step thinner (going from severely thick to thick, thick to normal, normal to thin, or thin to severely thin) or thicker (going from severely thin to thin, thin to normal, normal to thick, or thick to severely thick). The spell cannot make an atmosphere thicker than severely thick or thinner than severely thin.</p><p>In addition to the normal long-term effects of being in an atmosphere thinner or thicker than a creature is acclimated to, each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. This is true even for creatures with environmental protection from equipment (such as armor), as the air within the armor is affected on a failed saving throw. Creatures that do not need to breathe are not affected by changes in atmospheric density.</p><p>If the air is thicker than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, that creature becomes sickened. For every step beyond the first that the air is thicker than the target&rsquo;s acclimation, it takes a &ndash;1 penalty to its save against this effect. If the air is thinner than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, it is fatigued. For every step beyond the first that the air is thinner than the target&rsquo;s acclimation, it takes a &ndash;1 penalty to its saving throw against this effect. The effect ends if the creature moves out of the area, and it is not required to attempt a new saving throw upon reentering the area (instead it is subject only to the normal dangers of thicker or thinner air).</p><p>Toxicity: You can make the atmosphere toxic. Each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. Creatures with environmental protection from equipment already active (such as armor) are not exposed to the toxic atmosphere. A creature that fails its save contracts bubonic plague (no save) and immediately moves to the weakened state. Creatures that enter the area of toxic atmosphere later are exposed to inhaled bubonic plague and follow the normal disease rules for contracting the disease and progressing on the physical disease track. The disease is nonmagical, and those infected are still infected when the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.</p><p>Alternatively, you can make a normally toxic atmosphere nontoxic. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell&rsquo;s area does not expose those who breathe it to any toxic disease for the duration of the spell.</p>	4	null	4	transmutation	1 standard action	null	30-ft.-radius spread	4	null	10 minutes/level	Fortitude partial (see text)	no	PWD	204
56	Control Gravity	<p>Alter gravity in an area.</p>	<p>You can control gravity in an area, causing it to reverse, become zero-g, or become extremely strong. A creature or object within the area that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected (though if it stays in the area, it must succeed at a new save each round or become affected), but it might still suffer secondary effects (such as an object flying up from reversed gravity, or an object falling upon it when the spell ends). You choose how to have this spell affect gravity when you cast it, and you cannot change it without recasting the spell. If two control gravity spells affect the same area, they negate each other in the area of overlap.</p><p>If you reverse gravity in an area, you cause unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the affected area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the spell&rsquo;s area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling in either direction.</p><p>If you increase gravity in the area, creatures and objects weigh twice as much as normal, move at half speed, can jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by one step (from average to clumsy, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Acrobatics check to fly to remain in the air.</p><p>An area of zero-g works like the zero-g environment (see page 402). You can also use this spell to make areas of zero-g, heavy gravity, or light gravity act as normal gravity for the duration (see page 402).</p>	6	6	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	up to one 10-ft. cube/2 levels (S)	4	null	1 round/level (D)	Fortitude negates, see text	no	CRB	345
57	Control Machines	<p>Command technological constructs within range telepathically.</p>	<p>You wrest control of the target constructs and command them telepathically. You can issue commands to any number of controlled constructs on your turn, beginning when you cast this spell, as part of the concentration required to sustain its duration (a standard action).</p><p>If any of the constructs are under the control of a hostile creature, that controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s) to negate this spell&rsquo;s effect. Each construct under the control of another creature grants its controlling creature a separate saving throw to negate the effect for that construct.</p><p>While this spell is in effect, the affected constructs follow any command you give them, even if it would be dangerous to the controlled constructs. At the end of the spell, the constructs revert to their normal behavior. If they are intelligent, they know and remember that you used magic to control them.</p>	null	5	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	constructs of the technological subtype with individual CRs no greater than your level + 1 and a total CR no greater than twice your level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	concentration, up to 1 round/level	Will negates	no	CRB	345

At the end of the spell, the targets revert to their normal behavior.</p><p>If any of the undead are under the control of a hostile creature, that controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = the spell&rsquo;s DC) to negate this spell&rsquo;s effect if the creature failed its initial saving throw. Each undead under the control of another creature grants its controlling creature a separate saving throw to negate the effect for that undead.</p><p>Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them, and they may seek revenge after the spell&rsquo;s duration ends.</p>	6	6	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	3	undead creatures with individual CRs no greater than your level + 1 and a total CR no greater than twice your level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 minute/level	Will negates	yes	CRB	345
59	Corrosive Haze	<p>Cloud deals 4d8 acid damage per round, plus 10 additional damage.</p>	<p>A 5-foot cloud of acid-resistant nanites continually converts nearby water vapor into deadly acid. You can create the cloud in the same square as a creature and move it up to 30 feet in any direction as a move action on your turn. If the cloud enters (or is created in) a square containing a creature, it can&rsquo;t move any farther that round and deals 4d6 acid damage to that creature (Reflex negates). The acidic cloud also corrodes any unattended objects along its path, dealing them 4d8 acid damage.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t move the cloud, it remains where it is; if it shares its square with any creature at the beginning of your turn, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take 4d8 acid damage. Any creature that takes damage from the cloud takes 10 additional acid damage at the end of its next turn.</p>	null	4	null	evocation (acid)	1 standard action	5-ft.-diameter cloud of acid	null	4	null	1 round/level	Reflex negates	yes	CRB	346
60	Cosmic Eddy	<p>Whirlwind deals 4d6 damage and knocks creatures prone.</p>	<p>You pull dormant mystical energy from the land and objects around you and use it to create a swirling eddy that batters your foes and can hinder their movement. The eddy deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area. Additionally, creatures in the area are knocked prone and are reduced to half speed while the spell is in effect. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes only half damage and is not knocked prone, but it is still reduced to half speed. Flying creatures within the eddy&rsquo;s area must attempt an Acrobatics check to fly (DC equals the spell&rsquo;s save DC) each round. Failure means the creature cannot move for that round.</p><p>The spell deals damage and knocks creatures prone only once. However, if a creature leaves the spell&rsquo;s area and then returns, it is subject to the damage and other effects described above again (and can attempt another Reflex saving throw). Similarly, if a creature is not in this spell&rsquo;s area when it is first cast but later moves into it, it is subject to the damage and other effects described above.</p><p>Small, unattended items (no more than light bulk) are also thrown around in the eddy&rsquo;s area. At the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration, such items land in a randomly determined space within the spell&rsquo;s area.</p>	4	null	4	evocation	1 standard action	null	20-ft.-radius spread	4	null	1 round/level (D)	Reflex partial, see text	yes	CRB	346
61	Create Ammunition	<p>Create a specific type of ammunition, such as arrows or a battery.</p>	<p>You create a specific type of ammunition, such as arrows or a battery, and conjure it in hand or a place within range. You can create ammunition with an item level of 1 or 2, and you create a number of charges or pieces of ammunition as if you had purchased the ammunition (for example, 20 arrows or a battery with 20 charges). If you use this spell to create a battery, the battery can be used for any function a battery performs. This spell cannot create ammunition made from special materials or with any special quality, and it cannot create grenades, rockets, missiles, or the like.

You must make a ranged attack against the target&rsquo;s EAC to ensure this spell hits the necessary weak spots in the target&rsquo;s head, but you can add your key ability score modifier to this attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher. If you hit and the target fails a Fortitude saving throw, it takes 18d8 damage. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it instead takes 4d8 damage.

This immunity does not apply to such effects currently affecting the creature. The creature also gains a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against the following effects: mind-affecting, paralysis, and stunning effects; ability damage; ability drain; and any effect that requires a Fortitude saving throw (unless the effect works on objects or is harmless).<br />For effects that target creatures by type, the target creature counts as both its own type and undead (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).<br />When the spell ends, the above effects end and the target gains the exhausted condition.</p>	3	3	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	2	one willing living creature	10 minutes/level	none	no	NSP	155

The target can attempt a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. The target can&rsquo;t gain negative levels and is immune to any negative energy effects. This spell does not remove negative levels the target has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from negative levels for the duration of its effect.<br />Death ward does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.</p>	4	null	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	2	one living creature	1 minute/level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	348

Creatures with the lowest CR are affected first. Among creatures of equal CR, those who are closest to the spell&rsquo;s point of origin are affected first.

77	Destruction Protocol	<p>Turn nonhostile technological construct against your foes.</p>	<p>Waves of inciting programming ebb from your touch, reprogramming a construct to have murderous intentions toward your enemies. This spell must target a construct that is not already programmed or tasked with harming you. The target construct must have a CR lower than or equal to your level. If the target construct is under the control of another creature, the controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = the spell&rsquo;s DC) to negate this spell&rsquo;s effect.<br />While this spell is in effect, the construct is under your control. On your turn starting when you cast this spell, you must direct it to attack a target; the construct then pursues and attacks this target as best it can. You can change which target the construct attacks as part of your concentration to continue this spell&rsquo;s duration (a standard action). When you stop concentrating or when the spell&rsquo;s duration otherwise ends, the construct immediately stops following your commands to attack.</p>	null	4	null	enchantment	1 standard action	null	null	2	one nonhostile construct of the technological subtype; see text	concentration, up to 1 round/level	none	yes	CRB	348

If the target is poisoned or diseased, you automatically detect that fact and can determine the exact type of poison or disease with a successful DC 20 Intelligence or Wisdom check. If you are trained in Life Science or Medicine (depending on the nature of the poison or disease), you can attempt a DC 20 check of that skill if you fail your Wisdom or Intelligence check. If the target is cursed or suffering from a similar affliction, you must succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence or Wisdom check to determine that fact. You can then determine the exact nature of the curse with a successful DC 25 Mysticism check.</p>	0	0	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	3	one creature or object	instantaneous	none	yes (harmless)	CRB	348

The spell allows you to determine the type of augmentation, such as biotech, cybernetic, magitech, or necrotech, and its item level, but it does not reveal the function of the augmentation.

You can&rsquo;t detect magical traps in this way, as they are created with additional magic that wards them from this common spell. Each round you concentrate on the same area, you can determine if one magic source you detect is from a spell, magic item, or other effect, and the caster level (or item level) of the effect. You can&rsquo;t determine if there are magic sources in areas you can&rsquo;t see, or if there was a magic source in an area at one time but that has since expired.</p>	0	0	0	divination	1 standard action	null	cone-shaped emanation	17	null	concentration, up to 1 minute/level	none	no	CRB	348

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>	1	1	null	divination	1 standard action	null	120-ft. spherical emanation centered on you	19	null	10 minutes/level	none	no	CRB	348

You can&rsquo;t determine if there are technological items in areas you can&rsquo;t see, nor can you detect technological traps in this way.<br />The information this spell provides allows you to differentiate between charged items and items that replenish charges, but it does not provide any further information nor does it tell you, for example, how many charges an item currently has or how many maximum charges it can hold. This spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>	null	1	null	divination	1 standard action	null	cone-shaped burst	17	null	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	349
83	Detect Thoughts	<p>&ldquo;Listen&rdquo; to surface thoughts.</p>	<p>You detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures around you. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or target.<br />1st Round: You detect the presence or absence of thoughts from conscious creatures that have Intelligence scores of at least 1 (or an Intelligence modifier of &ndash;5) or higher.<br />2nd Round: You detect the number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score (or modifier) of each. If the highest Intelligence score is 26 (or a modifier of +8) or higher and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score (or 5 points higher than your own Intelligence modifier), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell doesn&rsquo;t let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can&rsquo;t see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.<br />3rd Round: You can read the surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target who succeeds at its Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 or an Intelligence modifier of &ndash;4 or lower) have simple, instinctual thoughts.<br />Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>	1	null	1	divination (mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	cone-shaped emanation	17	null	concentration, up to 1 minute/level	Will negates, see text	no	CRB	349
84	Digital Doorway	<p>Teleport from one computer to another within range.</p>	<p>You gain the ability to step into a piece of electronic equipment currently connected to a communication or information network (such as a comm unit or a computer connected to an infosphere), converting yourself into digital information and traveling along the network. Once uploaded onto a network, you teleport out from any device within 3,000 feet of the device that you entered; if no such device is in range, you emerge from the same device you entered. You are instantly aware of all unsecured devices connected to the same network as the one you entered, and you can attempt a Computers check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the item&rsquo;s level) to detect other devices (this does not require an action); a single check renders you aware of all devices whose DC to detect you exceeded. If the item is a computer, your Computers check result must also exceed the DC required to successfully hack it (Core Rulebook 214). This movement acts as the teleport spell, except there is no chance of missing your destination.<br />When attempting to enter or exit a computer with one or more countermeasures, you automatically trigger any countermeasures that are not successfully disabled. When you emerge from a computer, you can attempt one Computers check, with the result compared to the DC of each countermeasure in place on that computer (this does not require an action); you suffer the effects of all countermeasures with a DC higher than the result of your check. Some countermeasures triggered in this manner are exceptionally dangerous, as noted below.<br />Feedback: The digital virus uploaded into your data causes you to become exposed to the mindfire disease, but the disease has a save DC of 15 + half the item level of the destination device.<br />Firewall: You arrive at the destination prone, and you remain flat-footed and off-target for 1 minute.<br />Wipe: Your recent memories are scrambled, with minor elements removed, causing you to be confused for a number of rounds equal to half the item level of the destination device (minimum 1 round).</p>	null	4	null	conjuration (teleport)	1 standard action	null	null	1	you	1 hour/level or until expended; see text	null	null	PWD	205
85	Dimension Door	<p>Teleport a short distance.</p>	<p>You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired&mdash;whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating its direction. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You can also bring up to four additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to their maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. After using this spell, you can&rsquo;t take any other actions until your next turn (and each creature traveling with you can&rsquo;t take any other actions until its next turn).</p><p>If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you each take 1d6 damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take 2d6 additional damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take 4d6 additional damage and the spell simply fails.</p>	null	4	4	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	5	you and touched objects or touched willing or unconscious creatures	instantaneous	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	CRB	349

On a hit, the target is covered in a shimmering field that prevents planar travel. The target can&rsquo;t be affected by any effect that causes the target to move extradimensionally or to another plane, such as teleportation, summoning, plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and so on.

If the spell targets an object with charges, the object loses all of its remaining charges. If the object is powered by electrical means other than charges, its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds. If the spell targets a creature not of the technological subtype, it affects a random charged or electrically powered item in that creature&rsquo;s possession. If the target is a construct with the technological subtype, it is staggered and cannot use any energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A construct with the technological subtype that is affected by this spell can attempt a Fortitude saving throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect.</p>	null	3	null	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	4	one creature or technological object	instantaneous	Fortitude negates (object)	no	CRB	350
90	Discharge, Greater	<p>Disrupts or depowers multiple technological items or constructs.</p>	<p>This spell functions as discharge, except it can discharge multiple technological objects. You can use it in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.</p><p>Area Discharge: When used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature&rsquo;s possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.</p><p>Targeted Discharge: If this spell targets a single creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target&rsquo;s charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you have.</p>	null	6	null	abjuration	null	null	null	4	null	null	null	null	CRB	350

You can seem up to 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You can&rsquo;t change your creature type (although you can appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could merely add or obscure a minor feature, or you could look like an entirely different person or gender.</p><p>The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to the Disguise check (since it counts as altering your form). A creature that interacts with you directly can attempt a Will saving throw to recognize your appearance as an illusion.</p>	1	1	1	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	10 minutes/level (D)	null	null	CRB	350
92	Disintegrate	<p>Ray reduces one creature or object to dust.</p>	<p>Immense power shoots from your finger, with the potential to disintegrate a target where it stands.</p><p>When you cast this spell, a thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a ranged attack against your target&rsquo;s EAC, but you can add your key ability score bonus to this attack instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher. If you hit, the target takes 14d20 damage. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature&rsquo;s equipment is unaffected. Only one target is affected per casting of this spell.</p><p>When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, but it does not affect other magical effects that are not an object, creature, or force effect.</p><p>A creature or object that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw is partially affected, taking only 4d20 damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 Hit Points, the target is entirely disintegrated.</p>	null	6	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one creature or object, or up to a 10-ft. cube of nonliving matter	instantaneous	Fortitude partial (object)	yes	CRB	350

You can improve the spell&rsquo;s chance of success by presenting one object or substance that the target fears, hates, or otherwise opposes; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your caster level check to overcome the target&rsquo;s spell resistance (if any), and the save DC of the spell increases by 2. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, certain rare items might work twice as well, providing a +2 circumstance bonus to the caster level check to overcome spell resistance and increasing the spell&rsquo;s save DC by 4.<br />4th: When you cast dismissal as a 4th-level spell, it affects one extraplanar creature.</p>	4	4	4	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	3	see text	instantaneous	Will negates, see text	yes	CRB	350

95	Dispel Magic	<p>Cancel one magical spell or effect.</p>	<p>You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster&rsquo;s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled.<br />You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: as a targeted dispel or as a counter.<br /><strong>Targeted Dispel:</strong>&nbsp;One creature, object, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as &ldquo;that burning wall&rdquo; or &ldquo;the spell that&rsquo;s giving him those duplicates&rdquo;). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. If you succeed, the spell ends. If you don&rsquo;t specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random.<br />If you target a force, an object, or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant), you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.<br />If the object that you target is a magic item, you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item&rsquo;s nonmagical physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed holy laser pistol is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br />You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.<br /><strong>Counter:</strong>&nbsp;You can use the energy of dispel magic to disrupt the casting of other spells. First, select an opponent and take the ready action to cast dispel magic when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered, you cast dispel magic and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell. The DC is equal to 11 + the other spellcaster&rsquo;s caster level. If the check is successful and the target is in range, the spell fails and has no result.</p>	3	3	3	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	4	one creature, object, spell, or spellcaster	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	351
96	Dispel Magic, Greater	<p>Cancel multiple magical spells or effects.</p>	<p>This spell functions like dispel magic, except it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures. You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counter.<br /><strong>Targeted Dispel:</strong>&nbsp;This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but you can dispel one spell for every 4 caster levels you have, attempting a separate dispel check for each spell. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any curse that remove affliction can remove, even if dispel magic can&rsquo;t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse&rsquo;s DC.<br /><strong>Area Dispel:</strong>&nbsp;When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Attempt one dispel check and apply that check to each creature or object in the area, as if it were targeted by dispel magic. If you don&rsquo;t specify spells and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel spells at random. Magic items themselves are not affected by an area dispel but additional magical effects on them may be dispelled.<br />For each ongoing spell effect whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the result of the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the result of the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.<br />If an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell is in the area, apply the result of the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.<br />You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.<br /><strong>Counter:</strong>&nbsp;This functions as countering with dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus to your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell.</p>	5	5	5	abjuration	null	null	null	4	null	null	null	null	CRB	352
97	Displace Memory	<p>You deposit a memory into a small object.</p>	<p>You move one of your memories into the target object. You can select up to 5 minutes of continuous memory, or you can select every memory associated with one person, place, or object you name when you cast this spell. If you select continuous memory, you lose those memories, and if you try to recall them, you remember a blank gap instead of any details. If you select a person, place, or object, you remember events related to that thing, but not the presence or details of the thing you named. For example, if after a visit to Castrovel with your sister you use this spell to forget Castrovel, you remember traveling with your sister, but you forget where you went. Alternatively, if you used this spell to forget your sister, you remember going to Castrovel with someone, but not who was with you.<br />Anyone touching the object into which you placed your memories can recall those memories by speaking a command word that you designate at the time of casting. Alternatively, you can designate no command word so that no one can recall the memories when touching the object. If the object is destroyed, the memories placed within return to you.</p>	4	null	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	one object of negligible bulk	instantaneous	none (object)	no (object)	COM	134
98	Displacement	<p>Attacks miss target 50% of the time.</p>	<p>The target of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, displacement doesn&rsquo;t prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals the target&rsquo;s true location and negates the miss chance. If a creature with blindsense can also see the displaced creature, the visual and blindsense information combined are enough for the creature with blindsense to attack the displaced creature without a miss chance, unlike normal for blindsense.</p>	null	3	3	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	1 round/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	352
99	Divination	<p>Gain useful advice for specific proposed actions.</p>	<p>Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. Casting this spell requires you to expend 1 Resolve Point. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If you don&rsquo;t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The chance for a correct divination is 75%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.<br />As with augury, multiple castings of divination about the same topic by the same caster use the same die result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.</p>	4	null	null	divination	10 minutes	null	null	1	null	instantaneous	null	null	CRB	352

101	Dominate Person	<p>Control humanoid telepathically.</p>	<p>You fire a bright purple ray at your target, making a ranged attack against your target&rsquo;s EAC, but you can add your key ability score bonus to this attack instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher.<br />If you hit and your target fails its Will saving throw, you establish a telepathic link with the target&rsquo;s mind and can control its actions. If you and the target have a common language, you can generally force the target to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stand still.&rdquo; You know what the target is experiencing, but you don&rsquo;t receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.<br />By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the target, though it still can&rsquo;t communicate with you. You don&rsquo;t actually see through the target&rsquo;s eyes, but you still get a good idea of what&rsquo;s going on.<br />The target resists this control, and any target forced to take actions against its nature can attempt a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited as long as you and the target are on the same plane. You don&rsquo;t need to see the target to control it.<br />If you don&rsquo;t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each following day, the target can attempt a new saving throw to throw off the domination. You can be prevented from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the target is under the effects of some spells, but such effects don&rsquo;t automatically dispel the domination.</p>	5	null	null	enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting)	1 round	null	null	3	one humanoid	1 day/level; see text	Will negates	yes	CRB	352

The target weapons must deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage or the spell has no effect. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the metal plating on the weapons grants them the ability to overcome DR/silver and bypass DR/magic for the spell&rsquo;s duration.<br />If your caster level is 8th or higher, you can have weapons affected by this spell bypass DR/adamantine rather than DR/ silver. Weapons affected by this version of the spell are not considered adamantine for any other purpose (such as the ability to bypass hardness). If your caster level is 16th or higher, you can instead have affected weapons bypass DR that is bypassed by any other one metal with which you are familiar (either from having succeeded at a skill check to identify the weaknesses of a creature with DR, or from a successful Physical Science skill check to identify some other metal when you encountered it). Such weapons do not gain any other benefit from being made of the selected material.</p>	null	2	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	one melee or projectile weapon/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; see text	1 round/level	Fortitude negates (harmless, object)	yes (object)	ARM	157

As a reaction to another creature moving into a square of embers, you can ignite that square, causing flames to leap up and burn that creature.

If the item is so large that it can&rsquo;t fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the material is destroyed. This is an instantaneous effect.<br />You can employ entropic grasp in combat by making a melee attack against your opponent&rsquo;s EAC. If you hit, you instantaneously reduce a manufactured armor&rsquo;s KAC and EAC bonus by 3 (to a minimum of a +0 bonus). Damaged armor can be repaired using the Engineering skill; with a successful check, the armor&rsquo;s armor bonuses are restored to their original values. Against a manufactured creature (generally constructs, but not undead), this attack instead deals 6d12 damage.<br />Weapons and equipment in use by an opponent are more difficult to affect with this spell. You attempt a sunder combat maneuver against the item. If successful, you deal 6d6 damage to the weapon or item.<br />Used in combat, this spell lasts 1 round per level, and you can make one melee attack each round on future rounds as a standard action. The target can attempt a save to negate each melee attack, but success does not end the spell.<br />Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>	null	3	3	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	one nonmagical manufactured object (or the volume of the object within a 3-ft.-radius of the touched point) or one manufactured creature touched each round	see text	Fortitude negates (object)	no	CRB	353
118	Erase	<p>Remove writings of either magical or mundane nature.</p>	<p>Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from any written storage, including paper, computers, or similar devices. You remove up to 1,500 words worth of text (for computer files, this could be a 1,500-word data file or 1,500 words of computer code). With this spell, you can remove magic runes and glyphs created by spells of 3rd-level and lower.<br />Nonmagical writing in a book or manual is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Magical writing and computer programs must be touched (either directly or by touching the physical drive that holds the file) to be erased, and you must also succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level for the magical writing or the item level of the computer&rsquo;s drive. Computers generally keep backups on a round-by-round basis, and when you erase code from a computer, it takes 1 round for the computer to access its backups. If you erase a file that stores continuous data (like a camera feed), the computer won&rsquo;t be able to recover the missing round. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase writing that is part of a trap (magical or otherwise), you set off that trap.</p>	null	1	1	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	one written data set	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	353
119	Ethereal Jaunt	<p>You become ethereal for 1 round per level.</p>	<p>You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are on the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.<br />An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear events and creatures on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet and many kinds of senses (such as blindsense and blindsight) don&rsquo;t work across the planar boundary.<br />Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally, but force effects originating on the Ethereal Plane don&rsquo;t affect targets on the Material Plane. An ethereal creature can&rsquo;t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures and objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as you would if you were both on the Material Plane.<br />If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet that you so travel.</p>	6	6	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 round/level (D)	null	null	CRB	354

Movement through an area of etheric shards is halved, even for incorporeal creatures, and creatures entering a 5-foot cube filled with etheric shards take 1d8 slashing damage and must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or gain the bleeding 1 condition. The damage from this bleeding stacks with itself and other sources of bleeding. A creature that remains motionless within the area takes no damage, but such a creature is flat-footed unless it moves enough to defend itself, which forces it to take damage and attempt a saving throw.<br />Etheric shards are a magical trap. A creature trained in Mysticism and within 30 feet of the area can attempt a DC 35 Perception check to sense the shards. The shards cannot be disabled, but they can be dispelled.</p>	3	3	3	evocation (force)	1 standard action	null	one 10-ft. cube/level	4	null	1 hour/level (D)	Reflex partial or Reflex negates, see text	no	A!05	52

The spell allows you to move the target up or down as you wish. Each round as a move action, you can mentally direct the target up or down as much as 20 feet. You can&rsquo;t move the target horizontally. A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls, the second a &ndash;2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum of &ndash;5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at &ndash;1.<br /><br />This casting of the spell lasts 1 minute per caster level and is dismissible.<br /><br /><strong>3rd</strong>: When you cast&nbsp;<em>flight&nbsp;</em>as a 3rd-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and give it the power of flight. The target can fly at a speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. Flying while under this spell&rsquo;s effects takes no more concentration than walking, so the target can attack or cast spells normally. The target can charge but not run, and it can&rsquo;t carry aloft more weight than its normal bulk limit. The target gains a bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly equal to half your caster level.<br /><br />If this spell expires or is dispelled while the target is aloft, the target floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.<br /><br />The spell lasts for 1 minute per caster level.<br /><br /><strong>4th</strong>: When you cast&nbsp;<em>flight&nbsp;</em>as a 4th-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and affect it as per the 3rd-level version of the spell, except the target&rsquo;s fly speed is increased by 10 feet and the spell lasts for 10 minutes per caster level.<br /><br /><strong>5th</strong>: When you cast&nbsp;<em>flight&nbsp;</em>as a 5th-level spell, you can target yourself and be affected as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level. When you use this flight speed for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). You can cover 140 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 80 miles at a speed of 50 feet).<br /><br /><strong>6th</strong>: When you cast&nbsp;<em>flight&nbsp;</em>as a 6th-level spell, you can target multiple willing or unconscious creatures at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) and affect them as per the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can target one creature per caster level, all of which must be within 30 feet of each other.

142	Gravitational Singularity	<p>Particle with infinite density pulls creatures and objects into it, dealing 12d6 damage each round to those inside.</p>	<p>You call into being a tiny particle of mass with infinite density. You must conjure the singularity in a square that is unoccupied by any creatures or objects. When you finish casting this spell, the singularity immediately draws all Medium and smaller creatures and unattended objects of no more than light bulk within 30 feet toward it. Each round on your turn, the singularity makes a single special combat maneuver against creatures within 30 feet with an attack bonus equal to 4 + your caster level + your key ability modifier. Compare the result to each creature&rsquo;s KAC + 8. If the singularity is successful, that creature is moved 5 feet toward the singularity plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds a target&rsquo;s KAC + 8. Unattended objects are automatically moved 10 feet toward the singularity each round. If a creature or object is moved into the square that contains the singularity, it is sucked inside it and takes 12d6 damage at the end of its turn each round it remains within that space.<br /><br />A creature drawn into the singularity can take no actions except a full action to try to escape (it still takes damage during the rounds it attempts to escape). A creature must succeed at either an Athletics check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; your mystic level) or a DC 22 Strength check to escape the singularity. The singularity can hold up to four Medium creatures or objects (two Small creatures or objects count as one Medium creature, and so on); if it would pull in additional creatures, those creatures are simply pulled into a square adjacent to the singularity.<br /><br />A creature within 50 feet of the singularity has its speed reduced by half when it moves away from the singularity. However, it can move at double its normal speed when moving toward the singularity. If a creature moves within 30 feet of the singularity at any point in its movement, it is subject to the combat maneuver described above. A creature that moves neither toward nor away from the singularity moves at its normal speed.<br /><br />When this spell ends, the singularity disappears, and creatures and objects that were sucked into the singularity appear in the space where you conjured it (or as close as possible to that space, if they can&rsquo;t all fit within it).</p>	6	null	null	conjuration (creation)	1 round	5-ft.-cube gravitational singularity; see text	null	4	null	1 round/level (D)	none	no	CRB	357
143	Gravity Well	<p>Create a point of high gravity that knocks creatures in the area prone and pulls them closer to the center.</p>	<p>You alter the gravity in an area, making a central point of high gravity that pulls creatures toward it. Each creature in the area when the spell takes effect is knocked prone unless it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. Any creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be drawn 15 feet closer to the center of the area. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity.

144	Grease	<p>Make a 10-ft. square or one object slippery.</p>	<p>You cover a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means the creature can&rsquo;t move that round and must then succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone, while failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill on page 135 for details). A creature that doesn&rsquo;t move on its turn doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt this check and isn&rsquo;t considered flat-footed. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Unattended material objects are always affected by this spell. If you attempt to affect an object in a creature&rsquo;s possession, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate the effect. If the creature fails the initial saving throw, it immediately drops the item and must attempt a new save each round it attempts to pick up, hold, or use the item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +5 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to escape a grapple and a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against grapple combat maneuvers.</p>	null	1	1	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	3	null	1 minute/level (D)	Reflex partial, see text	no	CRB	357

The hologram memory can be no longer than 1 minute; if the extracted memory is longer than this, the hologram simply ends. The hologram includes audio as well as visual components, but it does not contain haptic, olfactory, or other components.

Make a melee attack against the target&rsquo;s EAC; if you hit, the nanobots deal 4d8 damage and swarm through the target&rsquo;s biological or mechanical systems, causing the creature to be confused, as per&nbsp;<em>confusion</em>, for 1 round per your caster level. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save, it takes only half damage and negates the confusion effect.

You decide which cybernetic augmentation to create when you cast this spell. The target must have the chosen system available for augmentation. If the target&rsquo;s chosen system already has its maximum number of augmentations, this spell has no effect.

This works like a physical or mental disease (your choice), except it ignores the target&rsquo;s immunity to diseases. The programming virus has a frequency of 1 hour and requires two consecutive saving throws to cure.&nbsp;<em>Detect affliction</em>&nbsp;can reveal the existence of this virus in a construct (the virus is considered a disease for purposes of that spell).

Mind-affecting effects deal only half damage&mdash;including ability score damage&mdash;to creatures in the area, before any reduction due to successful saves or other effects. When a creature within the area succeeds at a saving throw against an emotion or fear effect, they are not affected by that effect, even if that effect would have a partial effect on a successful saving throw.

184	Interplanetary Teleport	<p>Teleport between planets.</p>	<p>This spell functions as&nbsp;<em>teleport</em>, except there is no hard range limit and you don&rsquo;t need to have seen your destination. You can teleport to anywhere you are familiar with on the planet you are on while casting the spell, or you can teleport to any other planet in the same solar system. You must have an unambiguous idea of which world you wish to travel to (&ldquo;the third planet from the sun&rdquo; is an acceptable destination, but &ldquo;a habitable world with oceans&rdquo; is not). If you have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without a chance of failure; otherwise, you arrive at a location that would not immediately be life threatening. If no such safe landing zone exists on the world, such as someone attempting to travel into the sun without the proper precautions in place, the spell simply fails.</p>	null	6	6	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	10	you and touched objects or touched willing or unconscious creatures	instantaneous	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	CRB	362
185	Invisibility	<p>Target is invisible for 1 minute per level or until it attacks.</p>	<p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible (see page 264). If the target is a creature, any gear it is carrying vanishes as well. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the target unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.<br /><br />The spell ends if the target attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell or harmful effect targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Actions directed at unattended objects don&rsquo;t break the spell. Spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon security forces and have them attack, start a trash compactor with foes inside, remotely trigger traps, and so forth.</p>	null	2	2	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object no more than 10 bulk/level	1 minute/level (D)	Will negates (harmless, object), see text	yes (harmless, object)	CRB	362
186	Invisibility to Technology	<p>Technological items can&rsquo;t detect target.</p>	<p>The target and its gear cannot be detected by cameras, motion detectors, technological armor upgrades such as infrared sensors, biotech and cybernetic eyes or ears, or other technological devices, and it is invisible to constructs with the technological subtype. The target is missing from technological images captured while the spell lasts, security cameras do not display the target, microphones pick up no sounds the target makes, and the target cannot trigger technological traps. This spell creates disadvantages for the target, as well. Talking on a comm unit is impossible while subjected to this spell, and automatic doors do not open for the target.<br />Items dropped, put down, or thrown by the target become visible to technology. Items picked up disappear if tucked into clothing or a bag carried by the target. Light remains visible to technology, but a source of light might be invisible. If any part of an item the target carries extends more than 10 feet from the target, that part becomes visible to technology. This spell ends under the same circumstances as an invisibility spell.</p>	null	2	null	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object	1 minute/level (D)	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	COM	137

Individuals in the group can&rsquo;t see one another. Any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group loses the benefit of this spell. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.</p>	null	6	6	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	5	any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 180 ft. apart	1 round/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless, object)	CRB	362
189	Irradiate	<p>Flood area with dangerous radiation.</p>	<p>This spell floods the area of effect with dangerous radiation. The strength of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as detailed below. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect. Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The saving throw to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell rather than the standard save DC for radiation.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Caster Level</th><th>Radiation Level</th></tr><tr><td>6th or lower</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>7th&ndash;9th</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>10th&ndash;16th</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>17th or higher</td><td>Severe</td></tr></tbody></table>	3	3	3	conjuration (creation, disease, poison, radiation)	1 standard action	null	10-ft.-radius spread; see text	4	null	instantaneous	Fortitude partial, see text	no	CRB	362
190	Jolting Surge	<p>Touch deals 4d6 electricity damage.</p>	<p>You touch a target with a device you&rsquo;re holding that uses electricity, requiring a melee attack against the target&rsquo;s EAC. Alternatively, you can instead touch an electrical device a target is wearing (or a target that is an electrical device, such as a robot) with your hand, gaining a +2 bonus to your attack roll. Either way, if your attack hits, the electrical device surges out of control, dealing 4d6 electricity damage to your target.<br /><br />Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>	null	1	1	evocation (electricity)	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object	instantaneous	none	yes	CRB	363
191	Junk Armor	<p>Turn junk into light armor or upgrade light armor to heavy armor.</p>	<p>You turn a pile of technological junk into a suit of light armor, or use it to upgrade a suit of light armor to heavy armor. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.<br /><br />You can cause the armor to be created on yourself or an adjacent willing or unconscious ally. Light or heavy armor you create requires proficiency to use without penalties as normal. If you use this spell to create light armor, the armor has an EAC bonus equal to your caster level, a KAC bonus equal to your caster level + 2, and a maximum Dex bonus equal to 1 + onequarter your caster level. Using&nbsp;<em>junk armor</em>&nbsp;to temporarily turn light armor into heavy armor increases the armor&rsquo;s EAC bonus by 1 and its KAC bonus by 2, reduces its maximum Dexterity bonus by 3, and worsens its armor check penalty by 2.</p>	null	1	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	null	null	2	null	24 hours (D)	none	no	PWD	205
192	Junk Restraints	<p>4th - Transform junk into shackles or fetters.</p>	<p>You turn a pile of technological junk into fetters and shackles that restrain a creature within range. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.<br />While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with energy powerful enough to restrain a Large or smaller creature. The junk flies toward the creature and attaches itself to the creature&rsquo;s limbs or otherwise ensnares it, causing it to gain the entangled condition for the duration of the spell or until it ends the condition by succeeding at an Acrobatics check to escape as a move action. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 &times; your caster level.<br />If the targeted creature succeeds at a Reflex save, the junk lands adjacent to them harmlessly.</p>	null	4	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	at least 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text	1 round/2 levels (D)	Reflex negates; see text	no	NSP	156

The spell leaves behind 1 bulk of junked electronic equipment in the target creature&rsquo;s space that is suitable for targeting with spells such as battle junkbot, handy junkbot, healing junkbot, junk armor, junk restraints, or junksword. The junked electronics have no resale value and cannot be repaired into any functioning item. A creature trained in Engineering or Physical Science can reveal the useless nature of the junk by directly examining it.</p>	null	1	1	conjuration	1 standard action	instantaneous	null	3	one creature or objectEffect creates 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment	instantaneous	Reflex half	no	NSP	157
194	Junksword	<p>Turn junk into a one-handed melee weapon</p>	<p>You turn a pile of technological junk into a one-handed melee weapon that you can wield against your foes.

Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.<br />You are automatically proficient with this melee weapon, and you add 1-1/2 times your caster level to damage rolls with it (in place of a Weapon Specialization bonus). A junksword functions only for its creator, and once created it cannot leave your hand. Should you wish to sheathe it, the junksword obliges by collapsing into a wreath of junk that surrounds your hand like a glove.<br />You can grant your junksword additional abilities based on the spell&rsquo;s level.

199	Junksword	<p>Turn junk into a one-handed melee weapon</p>	<p>You turn a pile of technological junk into a one-handed melee weapon that you can wield against your foes. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.<br />You are automatically proficient with this melee weapon, and you add 1-1/2 times your caster level to damage rolls with it (in place of a Weapon Specialization bonus). A junksword functions only for its creator, and once created it cannot leave your hand. Should you wish to sheathe it, the junksword obliges by collapsing into a wreath of junk that surrounds your hand like a glove.<br />You can grant your junksword additional abilities based on the spell&rsquo;s level. You can change one modification to your junksword as a move action, or you can completely reconfigure all of its modifications as a full action.<br /><strong>1st:</strong>&nbsp;Your junksword deals 1d4 bludgeoning and slashing damage and has the analog weapon special property.

When you complete the casting of this spell, attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against the DC of the lock or computer seal with a +10 bonus. If successful,&nbsp;<em>knock</em>&nbsp;opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors (but doesn&rsquo;t identify secret doors you haven&rsquo;t found) as well as locked or trick-opening containers, starship doors, and similar secured entryways. It also loosens chains, shackles, or welds (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open a door closed with security seal, the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove the seal but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.&nbsp;<em>Knock&nbsp;</em>does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a force field barrier) or open any door or container larger than the spell&rsquo;s area, nor does it affect ropes, webs, and the like.</p>	null	2	2	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one door, container, or portal with an area of up to 10 sq. ft./level	instantaneous; see text	none	no	CRB	363

You must be able to identify the creature clearly from personal knowledge of who they are. If you and the creature you identify are not on the same planet-sized body, the spell fails. You can input the coordinates into any computer attached to an infosphere on the same planet to find general directions. If you use the Piloting skill&rsquo;s navigation task to reach the coordinates, these directions make your familiarity seldom visited (DC 15) even if the area would normally be unfamiliar.</p>	1	1	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	instantaneous	null	null	COM	137

Otherwise, the spell fails.<br />Creatures that move through the laser net must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 1d6+1 fire damage per 5 feet of laser net they move through.

This shell enables the targets to breathe freely in a variety of atmospheric conditions (including in corrosive, thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres), as well as underwater or in a vacuum. It also makes the targets immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons as well as spells with a harmful gaseous effect. In addition, the shell protects targets (and their equipment) from extreme temperatures (between &ndash;50&deg; and 140&deg; F) without having to attempt Fortitude saving throws, as well as extreme pressures.<br /><br /><em>Life bubble</em>&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t provide protection from energy damage, negative or positive energy (such as found on the Negative and Positive Energy Planes), or radiation; it also doesn&rsquo;t provide the ability to see in conditions of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog) or the ability to move or act normally in conditions that impede movement (such as underwater).</p>	1	1	1	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	4	up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 day/level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	363

The creature can attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage, and spell resistance applies.

You can&rsquo;t target specific parts of a creature, and objects are not damaged by the spell.<br /><br />You can target a single creature or several creatures, but each missile can strike only one creature.

The target can even have the broken condition. When you do so, you can cause the item to act as if you activated it without moving it from its space. If the target is a weapon, you can cause it to fire or activate for the rest of your turn. Then, you can make one attack against a creature in range using your ranged attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier or your melee attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier, whichever is applicable for the weapon you activate. If the target is a technological item with a usage entry, the item activates for the time listed in that usage entry.

If the target was in the middle of a task that requires longer than a single round to accomplish, it must begin again.

All of the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. A construct can benefit from this spell only once per day.

215	Meticulous Match	<p>You compare two similar items and know if they are identical to one another or not.</p>	<p>You compare two similar items and know if they are identical to one another or not. The spell can indicate an identical match, a categorical match, or no match. For instance, blood samples are identical if they are from the same creature. They are categorical if they are from the same species. No match exists if the blood samples are from different species or if one sample is stage blood.<br />Alternatively, you can compare dissimilar items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you can compare a creature&rsquo;s tooth against a bite mark and know whether that creature could have caused the bite mark. This spell is fallible. An identical match can result from comparing items that are duplicates of one another. For instance, a knife might have an identical match with a stab wound if an identical knife was used to inflict the wound. Identical twins might have identical blood or tissues.</p>	3	3	3	divination	10 minutes	null	null	2	two objects	null	Fort negates (object)	yes (object)	3C01	45

It instead remains in its area for the duration and penetrates armor environmental protections. Creatures within the miasma have concealment against attackers. A creature that breathes in the miasma must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. On a failure, the creature is nauseated while it remains in the area and is sickened for a number of rounds equal to your caster level once it leaves the area.

The microbots begin in a 10-foot-square area when you create them, and you can create the cloud so that it shares the space of other creatures. If no creatures are within the cloud&rsquo;s area, the microbots pursue and harass the nearest creature that is hostile to you as best they can each round. Although the microbots generally know which creatures are your enemies, you have no control over their targets or direction of travel. If there are multiple valid targets the microbots can harass, the cloud will split into a maximum of four 5-foot-square segments and pursue different targets.<br /><br />The cloud (and any segments thereof) has a fly speed of 20 feet. Each round on your turn, the microbot cloud grants harrying fire (see page 247) against the foes in its spaces. In addition, the cloud grants covering fire (see page 246) to anyone attacked by foes in its spaces. The microbots constantly repair themselves and the cloud generates new microbots every few seconds, so any attack against them is essentially ineffective.</p>	null	2	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	distracting cloud of microbots	null	3	null	concentration + 1 round	none	no	CRB	364

Your divided personas are aware of and can psychically communicate with one another, allowing them to coordinate their efforts and assist each other. At any point during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can focus a persona on assisting with a task, granting you one of the following abilities.

If it fails, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the answer you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds by 5 or more, it answers however it chooses and you believe that wrong answer to be the truth. Your questions are purely telepathic inquiries, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly into your mind.

You can maintain the swap at any range on the same plane. You can shift back to your body as a standard action, and doing so ends the spell. If your new body is killed, you return to your body and the target dies. If your body is killed, you can remain in the host&rsquo;s body for the duration or until it is killed. Then, you die if your body is still dead. However, if you recast this spell, you can reset the duration you remain in the target&rsquo;s body. You can cast this spell from a body that is not your own, swapping minds with a new target and resetting the spell&rsquo;s duration.

A miracle can do any of the following things.</p><ul><li>Duplicate any mystic spell of 6th level or lower.</li><li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.</li><li>Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind.</li><li>Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li></ul><p>At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, you may try to use a miracle to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous or the spell may have only a partial effect.<br />A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are the same as for a 7th-level spell. For the purpose of other effects that depend on spell level, miracle counts as a 9th-level spell.</p>	0	null	null	evocation	1 standard action	null	null	10	null	see text	see text	yes	CRB	366
230	Mirror Image	<p>Create decoy duplicates of yourself.</p>	<p>This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.<br /><br />When you cast&nbsp;<em>mirror image</em>, it creates 1d4 figment images. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack hits, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss, and an attack that misses you due to a miss chance also destroys an image. Area spells and effects that don&rsquo;t require an attack roll affect you normally and don&rsquo;t destroy any of your figments. Spells with a range of touch are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.<br /><br />An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect. Blindsense doesn&rsquo;t help distinguish the figments from the real you, but blindsight is sufficient to do so.</p>	null	2	2	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 minute/level	null	null	CRB	366
231	Mislead	<p>Make yourself invisible and create an illusory double of your likeness.</p>	<p>You become invisible (as greater invisibility), and at the same time, a figment double of you (as per a 3rd-level casting of holographic image) appears. The double appears within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don&rsquo;t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it can&rsquo;t attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.<br />The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.</p>	null	5	5	illusion	1 standard action	one illusory double	null	10	null	1 round/level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see text	none or Will disbelief, see text	no	CRB	366
232	Modify Memory	<p>Change 5 minutes of target&rsquo;s memories.</p>	<p>You reach into the target&rsquo;s mind and modify up to 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.</p><ul><li>Eliminate all memory of an event the target actually experienced. This spell cannot negate charm person, suggestion, or similar spells.</li><li>Allow the target to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.</li><li>Change the details of an event the target actually experienced.</li><li>Implant a memory of an event the target never experienced.</li></ul><p>Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the target. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the target moves beyond the spell&rsquo;s range at any point during this time, the spell fails.<br />A modified memory does not necessarily affect the target&rsquo;s actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature&rsquo;s natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is usually dismissed as a bad dream, a hallucination, or another similar excuse.</p>	5	null	5	enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting)	1 round; see text	null	null	3	one living creature	permanent	Will negates	yes	CRB	366

248	Nightmare	<p>Send a terrible nightmare to a distant target.</p>	<p>You precisely identify a target, such as by name or via a material connection like a personal possession or lock of its hair. The spell fails without expending a spell slot if the target isn&rsquo;t asleep or in a resting state similar to sleep. If you&rsquo;ve never met the target in person and lack a material connection to the target, the target gains a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the spell works, the target remains resting for 1 minute, then has a nightmare, rouses, and becomes frightened for 2d6 rounds. The target can&rsquo;t willingly reenter the affected resting state for 1 hour. To do so after this time has elapsed, the target must succeed at the saving throw again. If this save fails, the target can try again once per hour thereafter. After 24 hours have passed, this restless state ends.</p>	3	3	null	illusion (mind-affecting)	10 minutes	null	null	8	one living creature	instantaneous	Will negates	yes	SS1	52
249	Nondetection	<p>Hide target from divination and surveillance.</p>	<p>The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as&nbsp;<em>clairaudience/clairvoyance</em>&nbsp;and spells with the word &ldquo;detect&rdquo; in their names.&nbsp;<em>Nondetection</em>&nbsp;also prevents location by magic items such as&nbsp;<em>crystal balls</em>&nbsp;and technological items such as cameras and surveillance systems. Casting this spell places significant stress on you, and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point.<br /><br />If a magic divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level. If surveillance is attempted with remote cameras or sensors, the viewer must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level to see the target. If you cast&nbsp;<em>nondetection</em>&nbsp;on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC for each these checks is equal to 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature,&nbsp;<em>nondetection&nbsp;</em>wards the creature&rsquo;s gear as well as the creature itself.<br /><br /><em>Nondetection&nbsp;</em>protects the target only from discovery by items and remote sensors, not by creatures. A camera mounted to a wall and monitored from a security booth is subject to&nbsp;<em>nondetection</em>, but a camera in a creature (including constructs) is not.</p>	null	3	3	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object	1 hour/level	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	CRB	367

If the target regains Hit Points while affected, its Hit Points are restored to their maximum.</p>	null	2	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one technological item of up to 1 bulk/level, or one technological vehicle or construct of any size	1 hour/level	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	COM	138

252	Overload Systems	<p>Target creature has a 50% chance to lose each action.</p>	<p>By touching the target (usually requiring a melee attack roll against the target&rsquo;s EAC, but you can add your key ability score modifier instead of your Strength modifier if it is higher), you flood the target&rsquo;s body with random jolts of electricity or other interference. On a failed Fortitude save, the target is overwhelmed and potentially unable to perform tasks as normal. While this spell is in effect, whenever the target takes any action or reaction, there is a 50% chance that the target simply takes no action instead. Roll this chance separately for each action the target would take. For example, if the target wishes to move and attack during its turn, it would roll d% twice to determine whether it could take those actions&mdash;once before each action it wishes to take. Each attack of a full attack action counts as separate action.<br />This spell is effective against living and unliving creatures, and casting it doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>	null	4	null	enchantment (compulsion)	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	1 round/level	Fortitude negates	yes	CRB	368
253	Parallel Form	<p>Disguise creatures&rsquo; forms and equipment, and give targets a bonus to Bluff checks to impersonate individuals.</p>	<p>You pluck details from alternate-reality versions of targets to weave parallel forms, making the targets appear and act differently. You affect the targets as if they were each under a disguise self spell, deciding the details when you cast this spell. In addition, parallel form provides the mannerisms of the chosen form, and the tactile and audible properties of the target&rsquo;s equipment can seem different, although all the target&rsquo;s gear must appear to be of the same sort (for example, a melee weapon can appear to be only another sort of melee weapon). If you cast this spell to make the target appear to be a specific individual, the target gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Bluff checks to claim to be that individual. A creature that interacts with the target and succeeds at a Will saving throw recognizes the parallel form as an illusion.</p>	null	null	2	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	3	up to one willing creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 minute/level (D)	Will disbelief	no	COM	138

255	Passwall	<p>Create a passage through most walls.</p>	<p>You can create a passage through metal, plaster, plastic, stone, or wooden walls, but you can not create one through force fields, starship bulkheads, or other harder materials. The passage is 30 feet deep. If the wall&rsquo;s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single casting of passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several castings of passwall can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels passwall or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is more than one, or out the sole exit.</p>	null	5	5	transmutation	1 standard action	5-ft.-by-8-ft. opening	null	2	null	1 hour/level (D)	none	no	CRB	368

257	Perfect Recall	<p>Recall one memory unaltered by magic perfectly.</p>	<p>The target is able to recall memories with perfect clarity. If the target has been subjected to displace memory (see page 134), modify memory, or a similar effect, this spell provides no recall of those lost memories. However, the target realizes its memories have been altered by such a spell or effect.</p>	2	null	null	enchantment	1 standard action	null	null	2	one willing or unconscious creature	1 minute/level	no (harmless)	no (harmless)	COM	139

You treat gravity as if it were your choice of 1 step higher or lower (for example, if you were in an area of low gravity, you could choose either standard gravity or zero-g). You can suppress or resume this affect as a reaction or swift action. While under the effects of this spell, you can also reduce the distance of any forced movement that would affect you by 5 feet (minimum 0 feet), and you ignore penalties from the off-kilter condition.</p>	null	2	2	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 hour/level (D)	null	null	NSP	156

This phantom cycle is only partially real, with a shadowy finish, dark trim, and tires of ghostly mist. Only you can pilot this cycle, although anyone can be a passenger. For every caster level you have above 6th, your phantom cycle gains a 5-foot increase in speed, a 50-foot increase to its full speed, and a 5-mph increase to its overland movement.</p>	null	3	null	conjuration (creation)	1 round	one magical vehicle	null	2	null	1 hour/level	none	no	COM	139

This includes all teleportation spells, summoning spells, plane shifting, astral travel, and ethereal travel. Such effects simply fail automatically. Starships cannot enter or emerge from Drift travel in an area affected by this spell.<br />Dispel magic does not dispel your planar barrier effect unless the caster level of the creature attempting to dispel it is at least as high as your own. You can&rsquo;t have multiple overlapping planar barrier effects. If planar barrier effects woulds overlap, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.<br />A planar barrier can be made permanent with a special ritual, which takes 1 hour and requires materials worth 15,000 credits per 60-foot cube.</p>	6	6	6	abjuration	6 rounds	null	one 60-ft. cube/level (S)	4	null	24 hours	none	yes	CRB	368
262	Planar Binding	<p>Trap an extraplanar creature of CR 10 or lower until it performs a task.</p>	<p>Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, created by the spell within its range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom or breaks free. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual&rsquo;s proper name in casting the spell. The CR of the outsider you can call with planar binding depends on the spell&rsquo;s level.<br /><strong>4th:</strong>&nbsp;One outsider of CR 4 or lower<br /><strong>5th:</strong>&nbsp;One outsider of CR 7 or lower<br /><strong>6th:</strong>&nbsp;One outsider of CR 10 or lower<br />The target creature can attempt a Will saving throw. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it resists the spell. If it fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully using its spell resistance (meaning you fail a caster level check against its spell resistance), by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC = 15 + half your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day, and a natural 20 on this check always succeeds (and a natural 1 on your caster level check always fails). If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A planar barrier spell cast in the area prevents the creature from escaping via dimensional travel.<br />If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to convince the creature to perform a task for you in exchange for release and perhaps some sort of reward. The creature decides which terms it is willing to accept, and it must willingly agree to the terms; magical compulsion isn&rsquo;t sufficient. This continues until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. It never agrees to unreasonable commands.<br />Once the requested service has been completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back to its home plane. The creature might later seek revenge against you for having imprisoned it. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature can&rsquo;t complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for 10 days and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. A defined task that will take longer than 10 days usually counts as unreasonable. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.<br />When you use this spell to call a creature with the air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water subtype, the spell gains that descriptor.</p>	4	4	4	conjuration (calling); see text	10 minutes	null	null	3	see text	instantaneous; see text	Will negates	yes; see text	CRB	368

265	Plane Shift	<p>As many as eight creatures travel to another plane of your choice.</p>	<p>You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing or unconscious creatures are linked by hand in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by a single casting of plane shift. Arriving at a precise location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane (except for the Drift), though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from the last place one of the targets (your choice) was located last time that target traveled to that plane. If it&rsquo;s the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane, though you can use other means of transit, such as interplanetary teleport, to travel on the new plane. Mystics must have an object attuned to a specific plane or native to that plane in order to use plane shift to travel to a plane. A technomancer requires a planar navigational program for a specific plane in order to travel to that plane with plane shift. Special rituals, jealously hoarded by powerful technomancers and mystics, can allow you to travel to specific locations on the chosen plane, or even to unknown worlds.</p>	6	6	6	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature, or up to eight willing or unconscious creatures	instantaneous	Will negates	yes	CRB	369

Any technological or hybrid armor upgrades cease to function for the duration of the spell. Entirely magical enhancements, such as weapon fusions, continue to function normally. Weapons that normally deal energy damage deal bludgeoning and piercing damage instead, lose any critical hit effects, and target KAC. Other weapon special properties, such as boost and bright, might also cease to function for the duration of the spell, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.<br />This spell has no effect on natural weapons and weapons entirely of magical or supernatural origins, such as a solarian&rsquo;s solar weapon.</p>	null	null	3	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	one weapon or suit of armor	1 round/level (D)	Fortitude negates (object)	yes	NSP	156

For the duration of the spell, creatures flying in the area must succeed at an Acrobatics check to fly in dangerous wind conditions, and terrain within the spell&rsquo;s area is covered with ice and snow, causing it to become difficult terrain.</p>	3	null	3	evocation (cold)	1 standard action	null	cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)	4	null	1 round plus 1 round/level	Reflex half	no	NSP	156

Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.<br />While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they&rsquo;re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct (about the size of a small apple) with the magical subtype. They each have 1 Hit Point and EAC and KAC of 18, and they fly at a speed of 30 feet with a +20 bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly and a +16 bonus to Stealth checks. An eye has a +20 Perception bonus and is subject to darkness, fog, illusions, and any other factors that affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling in darkness must find its way by touch.<br />When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than 25 words. The eyes know anything you know.<br />In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each eye replays in your mind all that it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying all of its findings, an eye simply disappears.<br />If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won&rsquo;t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.<br />The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy the eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel.</p>	null	5	null	divination	1 minute	20 magical sensors	null	21	null	1 hour/level (D); see text	none	no	CRB	370

It also eliminates all ongoing confusion, fear, and insanity effects. Psychic surgery also removes any mental afflictions that could be removed with dispel magic, as well as mental diseases. Psychic surgery removes all effects magically altering the target&rsquo;s memory, even instantaneous effects, and it can restore a memory to perfect clarity (even if the memory loss is due to the mundane passage of time).</p>	6	null	null	enchantment (mind-affecting)	10 minutes	null	null	2	one willing or unconscious, living creature	instantaneous	none	no	CRB	370

As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range. You can&rsquo;t perform complex operations, such as firing a gun or using a computer, but you can shut a mechanical door or lid and work simple buttons to open or close automated doors or trigger an alarm.</p>	0	0	0	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	one unattended object of no more than 10 lbs. or 1 bulk	concentration	none	no	CRB	370

A creature immobilized in this way cannot move and must hold its breath. The creature can still attack with any of its weapons (except any bite attacks), cast spells, and so on. Each round the spell affects the target, the target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to halve the damage and avoid being immobilized.</p>	3	null	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	3	one creature that breathes	concentration up to 1 round/level	Fortitude partial, see text	yes	CRB	370

You can target two creatures within 20 feet of each other with the effect described above, or target only one creature, who takes 2d4 piercing damage and gains bleeding 2 for 3 rounds.</p>	null	null	1	evocation	1 standard action; see text	null	null	4	one or two creatures; see text	instantaneous	none	yes	COM	140

The orbs increase the light level by one step within a 10-foot-radius of the target. Anytime the target of the spell takes fire damage from an attack or spell, they can spend a reaction to have one of the orbs absorb the blow. That orb disappears and the amount of fire damage is reduced by 5. The orbs cannot be used to absorb fire damage that comes from a continuous or natural environmental effect, such as walking in lava or damage from the burning condition. The spell ends when all three orbs are expended in this manner.</p>	1	null	null	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	4	one creature	1 hour/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	DF06	53

290	Raise Dead	<p>Restore life to a creature that died no more than 1 day per level ago.</p>	<p>You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In addition, the target&rsquo;s soul must be free and willing to return. If the target&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell fails; therefore, a target that wants to return to life receives no saving throw against this spell. Casting this spell requires you to create a complex representation of the target deceased creature, worth at least 5,000 credits, to serve as a beacon for the creature&rsquo;s soul. This object is consumed when you cast the spell.<br />Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by a creature&rsquo;s ability that bestows permanent negative levels. If the target is 1st level, it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can&rsquo;t be raised). A raised creature returns with no Resolve Points, no Stamina Points, and no spell slots (until it rests to recover them normally). It has 5 Hit Points. Any ability scores reduced to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the target, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life.<br />The spell can&rsquo;t bring back a creature that has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, and outsiders can&rsquo;t be raised by this spell. It is possible to bring back a creature that has been turned into an undead creature, but the beacon for the creature&rsquo;s soul must be more powerful, and must be worth at least 15,000 credits.</p>	5	null	5	conjuration (healing)	1 minute	null	null	2	one dead creature	instantaneous	none, see text	yes (harmless)	CRB	370

On a hit, the target is immediately exhausted for the spell&rsquo;s duration. A creature that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw is only fatigued, unless it is already fatigued, in which case it instead becomes exhausted despite the saving throw.<br />This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell&rsquo;s duration expires.</p>	3	null	3	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	3	one creature	1 minute/level	Fortitude partial, see text	yes	CRB	371
293	Read the Flames	<p>Gives you a single use bonus in the near future.</p>	<p>While casting this spell, you must focus on a semi-controlled flame (such as one produced by a lighter or a weapon with the flaming weapon fusion), centering your mind and analyzing the blaze&rsquo;s movements for subtle patterns that describe the underlying fundamentals of the universe. Once during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can center yourself as a standard action (this is a purely mental action) to remember your time spent scrutinizing the flame, choosing one of the benefits below. When the chosen effect ends, so does the spell.<br /><strong>Mental Clarity:</strong>&nbsp;At some point during the next 10 minutes, you can reroll one skill check with a +4 circumstance bonus.<br /><strong>Physical Clarity:</strong>&nbsp;You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to EAC and KAC until the end of your next turn.<br /><strong>Spiritual Clarity:</strong>&nbsp;You can immediately attempt a new saving throw against any mind-affecting effect currently affecting you.</p>	4	null	null	divination	10 minutes	null	null	1	null	24 hours	null	null	DF06	53

Once per round, even when it is not your turn, you can move your target up to 10 feet into a space it is willing and able to occupy. This movement can occur only between resolved actions and does not trigger reactions. When you concentrate on this spell, you can shift your focus to a different target.</p>	null	null	5	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one willing creature; see text	concentration + 1 round	none (harmless)	no	COM	140

When you cast this spell, you state the direction you wish to travel, the distance within range, and the specific square in which you&rsquo;re trying to arrive. You can bring along objects, provided their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You travel the correct direction and distance, but you have a 50% chance to arrive elsewhere than your intended square. If you do, use the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram (Starfinder Core Rulebook 245) to determine the direction you deviate from the intended destination. You arrive 1d6 squares away in that direction, although your deviation cannot cause you to exceed this spell&rsquo;s range. If you arrive in a place already occupied by a solid object or body, you take 1d6 damage and are shunted to the nearest open space with a suitable surface.</p>	null	null	2	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	5	personal	instantaneous	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	COM	140
296	Reanimate	<p>Reanimate a recently destroyed construct or undead.</p>	<p>You can reanimate a dead construct or destroyed undead creature that has been dead or destroyed for no longer than 1 day per caster level. If the target had a soul, that soul must be free and willing to return; a target that wants to be reanimated receives no saving throw against this spell, but if the target&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell fails. Casting this spell requires you to create a complex representation of the target deceased creature worth at least 7,500 credits to serve as a blueprint regarding its reanimation. This object is consumed when you cast the spell. If the target is an undead whose existence is tied to an object (such as a necrovite and its electroencephalon), it cannot be brought back without a new version of that object (with at least the same price as the original).<br />A reanimated creature returns with no Resolve Points, no Stamina Points, and no spell slots (until it rests to recover them normally). It has 5 Hit Points. Any ability scores reduced to 0 are raised to 1 (though any ability score it normally does not have is unchanged). Diseases, poisons, curses, and computer programming or viruses that affected the target at the time of its destruction remain in effect after reanimation. The spell closes wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, but if the body of the creature to be reanimated isn&rsquo;t whole, any missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life.<br />This spell can reanimate constructs and undead but cannot raise outsiders or restore life to other creatures. Reanimated undead return to unlife as the same type of undead that they were prior to their destruction.</p>	5	6	null	necromancy	1 minute	null	null	2	one dead construct or undead creature	instantaneous	none, see text	yes (harmless)	PWD	207
297	Reanimate Construct	<p>4th - Reanimate a destroyed technological creature to serve you.</p>	<p>This spell turns a destroyed construct into a creature that obeys your spoken commands. As a standard action, you can instruct a reanimated construct to either follow you or attack any creature (or type of creature) within 100 feet. This spell otherwise functions like animate dead, and constructs you reanimate with this spell count against the total amount of undead you can control with that spell (and vice versa).<br />The reanimated construct is similar to a fully functional version of that creature with the following changes. It has only half of its original Hit Points; any technological gear functions without batteries but technological weapons that require a charge deal only half damage; and it does not regain any uses of consumable items or weapons, such as grenades, or daily-use abilities. The reanimated construct is treated as both magical and technological for all effects (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).<br />The target construct must be mostly intact; creatures that have self-destructed, been disintegrated, been used as the target of a spell with &ldquo;junk&rdquo; in its name, and the like are not valid targets for this spell.</p>	4	4	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	one destroyed construct creature	instantaneous	none	no	NSP	157

Since this spell takes your personal energy, you must spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it. If you recharge a battery, there is a 20% chance the battery is destroyed by the attempt. If you restore more charges than the item can hold, the item must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 electricity damage for each excess charge. This spell provides no knowledge of how many charges an item can safely hold, but you can choose to bestow fewer charges than the maximum allowed to reduce the risk; you must declare how many charges you are restoring before casting this spell.</p>	null	2	null	evocation	1 round	null	null	2	one object	instantaneous	Fortitude negates (object)	yes (object)	CRB	372
300	Reflecting Armor	<p>Sheath of mystical force can reflect damage back on foe.</p>	<p>You create a shimmering skin-like coating of mystical force that covers your body, allowing you to reflect damage you take back against your attacker. At any time during this spell&rsquo;s duration, when you take Hit Point damage from an attack made with a weapon by a foe within 100 feet, you can choose to dismiss the spell as a reaction. If you do, the armor crackles with energy as it disappears, arcing through the air to strike the attacking creature, which takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage dealt to you at the time this spell was dismissed (maximum 10). The target can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.</p>	1	null	null	abjuration (force)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	10 minutes/level or until dismissed (D); see text	null	null	CRB	372

After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.<br />Regenerate also restores 12d8 Hit Points, rids the target of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the target has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).</p>	6	null	null	conjuration (healing)	3 rounds	null	null	2	one living creature	instantaneous	Fortitude negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	372
302	Reincarnate	<p>Bring a target dead creature back to life in a random body.</p>	<p>When you cast this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the target&rsquo;s soul is free and willing to return. If the target&rsquo;s soul is not willing to return, the spell fails; therefore, a target that wants to return receives no saving throw. Casting this spell requires a special monument worth at least 1,000 credits to serve as a beacon for the departed creature&rsquo;s soul. This object is consumed when you cast the spell.<br />Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are removed. The condition of the creature&rsquo;s remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature&rsquo;s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature&rsquo;s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the target is reincarnated.<br />A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class features, feats, and skill ranks it formerly had. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and Hit Points are unchanged. The creature should recalculate its ability scores from scratch as a member of its new race (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the target is 1st level, it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if the Constitution drain would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, the creature cannot be reincarnated). The target creature can decide whether its new body retains any of the implants it had in its former body. A spellcasting creature has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.<br />For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the facing page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.<br />Elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can&rsquo;t be reincarnated. Any creature that can&rsquo;t benefit from the mystic cure spell cannot be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.<br />The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including any forms of movement and speeds, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it does not automatically speak the language of the new form it takes.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>D%</th><th>Incarnation</th></tr><tr><td>1&ndash;6</td><td>Android</td></tr><tr><td>7&ndash;14</td><td>Dwarf</td></tr><tr><td>15&ndash;22</td><td>Elf</td></tr><tr><td>23&ndash;30</td><td>Gnome</td></tr><tr><td>31&ndash;34</td><td>Half-elf</td></tr><tr><td>35&ndash;38</td><td>Half-orc</td></tr><tr><td>39&ndash;46</td><td>Halfling</td></tr><tr><td>47&ndash;55</td><td>Human</td></tr><tr><td>56&ndash;64</td><td>Lashunta</td></tr><tr><td>65&ndash;73</td><td>Kasatha</td></tr><tr><td>74&ndash;81</td><td>Shirren</td></tr><tr><td>82&ndash;90</td><td>Vesk</td></tr><tr><td>91&ndash;99</td><td>Ysoki</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>Other (GM&rsquo;s choice)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A miracle or wish spell can restore a reincarnated creature to its original form.</p>	4	null	4	transmutation	10 minutes	null	null	2	one dead creature	instantaneous; see text	none, see text	yes (harmless)	CRB	372

305	Remove Affliction	<p>Neutralize curses, diseases, infestations, poisons, and other harmful conditions affecting a creature.</p>	<p>You remove impurities from a creature or object, potentially neutralizing the curses, diseases, infestations, poisons, and other harmful conditions affecting it. If the target is a creature, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) for each curse, disease, infestation, and poison affecting it (DC = 4 + the DC of the affliction). Success means that affliction is removed. Additionally, if the target is blind or deaf due to an affliction or damage, remove affliction restores vision and hearing unless the appropriate organ has been entirely removed from the creature&rsquo;s body.<br />A creature that is cured with remove affliction takes no additional effects from the curses, diseases, infestations, or poisons removed, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as Hit Point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don&rsquo;t go away on their own (such as poison states). This spell cannot remove the curse from a cursed item, though a successful caster level check enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove the curse and get rid of it. Since the spell&rsquo;s duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent the target from suffering from the same curse, disease, infestation, or poison after a new exposure at a later date.<br />from suffering from the same curse, disease, infestation, or poison after a new exposure at a later date.<br />Remove affliction counters bestow curse.</p>	3	null	3	conjuration (healing)	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature or object	instantaneous or 10 minutes/level; see text	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	CRB	373

Lesser remove condition also doesn&rsquo;t cure or remove other damage or conditions the target is suffering from any source, even the same source that caused the removed condition.

The target is cured of both the radiation&rsquo;s poison effects and the radiation sickness disease, moving the target to the healthy state on both tracks. When cast on an area, a single casting of remove radioactivity removes radiation from a 20-foot-radius area around the point you touch.

This damage reduction or energy resistance doesn’t stack with any damage reduction or energy resistance the target already has, and multiple castings of this spell don’t stack.</p>	3	3	3	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature wearing armor	10 minutes/level	Fortitude negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	374
316	Restoration	<p>Restores ability score drain and negative levels.</p>	<p>This spell functions as lesser restoration, except it also removes temporary negative levels or 1 permanent negative level. You must spend 5 Resolve Points when casting this spell to remove a permanent negative level. This spell can&rsquo;t be used to remove more than 1 permanent negative level from a target in a 1-week period.<br />Restoration heals all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target, but it doesn&rsquo;t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. A target that has benefited from the removal of fatigue or exhaustion from this spell can&rsquo;t benefit from either effect again for 24 hours.</p>	4	null	null	conjuration (healing)	3 rounds	null	null	2	one creature	instantaneous	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	374

It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the creature or improves an exhausted condition to fatigued, but it doesn&rsquo;t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. It also doesn&rsquo;t heal permanent ability drain.

318	Retrocognition	<p>Gain psychic impressions of past events in a certain location.</p>	<p>This spell allows you to gain psychic impressions from past events that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last hour throughout the first minute of the spell&rsquo;s duration, followed by impressions from the next hour back throughout the next minute you concentrate, and so on. If a psychically traumatic or turbulent event happened during that period, you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 15, 20, or 25, depending on the severity of the traumatic or turbulent event) or lose your concentration on the spell. If you fail this saving throw, the spell ends.<br />At mystic level 16th and higher, you can choose to collect impressions from over the course of a longer interval of time than an hour, beginning at 1 week per minute of concentration (as listed on the table below). The amount of detail you receive diminishes, so this eventually makes it harder to distinguish impressions left by anything but the most major events. In most circumstances, you can&rsquo;t glean information about what occurred during the Gap with this spell.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Mystic Level</th><th>Period</th></tr><tr><td>16th&ndash;17th</td><td>1 week per minute</td></tr><tr><td>18th&ndash;19th</td><td>1 year per minute</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>1 decade per minute<br /><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>	5	null	null	divination	1 minute	null	null	1	null	concentration, up to 1 minute/level	null	null	CRB	375
319	Rewire Flesh	<p>Turn target partially into a robot, dealing 3d6 damage per round and reducing speed.</p>	<p>Like rewriting the code that makes up a computer program, you manipulate the target&rsquo;s DNA to painfully rewire that target&rsquo;s biological functions to mimic the cold and rigid processes of a robot. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw, or all of its movement speeds are halved and it takes 3d6 slashing damage per round on its turn as its internal organs shift and transform to become more like the inner components of a robot. Each round, the target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to halve the damage this spell causes.<br />While this spell is in effect, the target&rsquo;s body becomes visibly more robotic; its voice is tinny and halting, its movements are jerky, and its face is unmoving and emotionless. The target has the flat-footed condition, and it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to all Sense Motive checks as well as to all Charisma-based and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks.</p>	null	4	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	4	one living creature	1 round/level (D); see text	Will negates and Fortitude half, see text	yes	CRB	375

You do not learn the location of or direction to these conditions, only their presence. However, after concentrating for a time, you can learn the following additional information.<br /><strong>1 Minute:</strong>&nbsp;Forecast the weather (Core Rulebook 398&ndash;400) for the next 48 hours, including the direction it will come from.<br /><strong>5 Minutes:</strong>&nbsp;Learn which atmospheres, biomes, and gravity are in the area, if they vary, as well as the direction and distance to those elements.<br /><strong>10 Minutes:</strong>&nbsp;Learn if anything in the area presents an environmental hazard (Core Rulebook 400&ndash;405), including cold or heat dangers (at what temperature range), radiation (at what severity), smoke effects, and underwater conditions.

322	Security Protocol	<p>Protect a building or starship with various technological and magical defenses.</p>	<p>You protect one building or starship you are within by outfitting it with various technological and magical effects. This spell can protect a contiguous area delineated by walls or other enclosed structures, such as part of a large indoor complex, but you must designate the area along the walls or other significant partitions that separate rooms and corridors&mdash;the area cannot protect only part of any room or hallway.<br />Once cast, this spell creates the following effects. Effects that allow saving throws or spell resistance say so. Spell effects are treated as if you had cast that spell at your caster level, have a save DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s, and last as long as this spell does.<br /><strong>Confusion:</strong>&nbsp;Where choices in direction exist, a minor confusing effect imposes a 50% chance that the creature goes in a random wrong direction. This is an enchantment, mindaffecting effect. Spell resistance applies.<br /><strong>Doors:</strong>&nbsp;Doors you choose are affected as if by security seal.<br /><strong>Fog:</strong>&nbsp;Areas you designate are filled with dense fog clouds that obscure the area like a fog cloud spell, up to a number of clouds equal to half your caster level.<br /><strong>Hidden Doors:</strong>&nbsp;One door per caster level can be concealed with a 1st-level holographic image that makes it appear to be a plain wall. This effect allows a Will saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, with a DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s DC.<br /><strong>Laser Nets:</strong>&nbsp;Areas you designate are protected as if by the laser net spell (see page 137). This effect allows Reflex saves as described in that spell, with a DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s DC.<br />In addition, when you cast this spell, you can place one of the following effects.</p><ul><li>Dancing lights in four corridors, as the spell.</li><li>Grease in two places. This effect allows Reflex saving throws as described in that spell, with a DC equal to this spell&rsquo;s DC.</li><li>Logic bomb on two computers in the area.

323	Security Seal	<p>Magically lock a portal, a container, or a security system.</p>	<p>A security seal spell magically locks a single door, container with a lid or latch, portal, or computer system. Casting this spell requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point. You can freely bypass your own security seal without affecting it. If the sealed object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 5 while it remains attached to the object. If the object doesn&rsquo;t have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a successful DC 20 Engineering check to disable devices. If the sealed object has computer security, the DC to bypass that security increases by 5. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell. Add 5 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A knock spell removes the security seal automatically, counting as one means of closure.</p>	null	2	null	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	2	one door, container, or portal up to 30 sq. ft./level in size	24 hours	none	no	CRB	376

Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible and invisible or ethereal creatures.<br />The spell doesn&rsquo;t reveal the method used to obtain invisibility, doesn&rsquo;t reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects, and doesn&rsquo;t reveal creatures that are simply concealed, hiding, or otherwise hard to see.</p>	2	2	2	divination	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	10 minutes/level (D)	null	null	CRB	376
325	Seeking Shot	<p>Cause a single attack to ignore cover and concealment.</p>	<p>You create a spiritual link between a weapon you touch and one target you can perceive with a precise sense at the time of casting. The next attack made with that weapon against that target (as long as it is within 1 minute) ignores cover and concealment. If the attack is a ranged attack, it does not need a line of effect as long as some route exists between the weapon and the target (regardless of how circuitous that route is). The attack is subject to the normal penalties from range increments.</p>	1	null	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	2	one weapon	see text	none	no	PWD	207
326	Shadow Body	<p>Merge yourself with the essence of Shadow, giving you great powers for a time.</p>	<p>You transform the matter of your body and any objects you carry or wear into the essence of the Shadow Plane. You are visible as an unattached shadow in bright light or normal light, but you gain total concealment in dim light or darkness (reduced to concealment against creatures that have darkvision). Your body and gear are incorporeal, but you can&rsquo;t fly or pass through solid objects or creatures, and your gear can&rsquo;t be removed from you or used by anyone. You can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal and vertical surfaces and liquids, and difficult terrain doesn&rsquo;t slow you. However, you can&rsquo;t attack physically or manipulate objects. You can speak, cast spells that require no items to cast, and perform mental actions. If you can use spells that have a range of touch and such a spell requires an attack roll, you target EAC. If you lose consciousness, you and your gear return to your natural form.</p>	5	5	null	transmutation (polymorph, shadow)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 minute/level (D)	null	null	SS1	52
327	Shadow Jump	<p>Travel through the Shadow Plane to move to a distant shadow.</p>	<p>Your body forms a connection to the Shadow Plane, allowing you to teleport through it, rather than the Astral Plane, with ease. While this spell is active, as a move action, you can teleport to any area of dim light or darkness you can see within range. If you leave a threatened space, you have concealment (20% miss chance) against any foe that makes an attack of opportunity against you.</p>	4	4	null	conjuration (shadow, teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	3	you and touched objects	concentration, 1 round + 1 round/3 levels (D)	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	SS3	53
328	Shadow Walk	<p>Step into a shadowy realm to travel to a destination rapidly.</p>	<p>To use shadow walk, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature or vehicle you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.<br />All targets affected must be in direct contact with one another. A Large target counts as two Medium targets, a Huge target counts as four Medium targets, and so forth. Creatures you transport this way can opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if the creatures are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect.<br />In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 200 miles per hour. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can&rsquo;t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It&rsquo;s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 &times; 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no saving throw).<br />Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow (except for the Drift), but this usage requires you to travel across the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality, which takes 1d4 hours.</p>	6	6	6	illusion (shadow)	1 standard action	null	null	2	up to one Medium creature or vehicle/level	1 hour/level (D)	Will negates (object)	yes (object)	CRB	376
329	Shadowy Fleet	<p>Illusion of starships deals 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 fire damage to all creatures in the affected area.</p>	<p>You create a powerful vision of a fleet of hostile starships overhead that appears to rain fiery laser shots mercilessly at your enemies. The ships appear to be 1,000 feet overhead and target a 60-foot-radius area that you designate on the ground. You can&rsquo;t cast this spell indoors unless you are within a structure that a fleet of starships could believably fit within.<br />Each round this spell is in effect, the starships deal 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 fire damage to all hostile creatures in the area as the ships appear to shoot lasers at your enemies. If a creature interacts with the illusion (such as by taking damage), it can attempt a Will saving throw to take only half of this damage per round for the remainder of the spell. Regardless of whether a creature disbelieves the illusion, each round it takes damage from this spell, it can attempt a Reflex saving throw to instead take half damage; thus, if a creature that succeeded at its Will saving throw also succeeds at its Reflex save in a given round, it takes one-quarter the spell&rsquo;s damage that round.</p>	null	6	null	illusion (shadow)	1 standard action	null	60-ft. radius	5	null	1 round/level	Will disbelief and Reflex half, see text	yes	CRB	376
330	Share Language	<p>Target understands chosen languages.</p>	<p>For 24 hours, the target can read, understand, and communicate to the best of its ability in up to three languages that you already know. This doesn&rsquo;t change the physical nature of the creature (if it lacks a means of speech, it still can&rsquo;t talk) or its attitude toward you. It does, however, allow intelligent creatures that normally have no language to understand and (if physically capable) communicate in the languages granted by this spell.</p>	1	null	null	divination	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	24 hours	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	377
331	Share Memory	<p>Target shares memory with you and five others.</p>	<p>You allow the target to share a memory with you and up to five other creatures, all of whom must be willing and within 30 feet of the target when you cast this spell. You designate which memories the target shares when you cast this spell, although the target can guide you in this designation. The designated memory can be as specific as &ldquo;the conversation you just had with the captain&rdquo; or as vague as &ldquo;your favorite childhood memory of being with your father.&rdquo; For the duration, those sharing the memory experience it through the target&rsquo;s senses as the target did. Anyone sharing the memory can cease participation at any time. If you end the effect for yourself, or the target ceases sharing, the spell ends. If the memory&rsquo;s length exceeds the duration, it plays out while this spell lasts and then ends with the duration. This spell does not work on memories that have been magically altered or removed through spells such as displace memory (see page 134) or modify memory.</p>	1	null	null	divination	1 round	null	null	2	one willing creature	concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)	none	yes	COM	141
332	Shield Other	<p>You take half of the target&rsquo;s Hit Point damage.</p>	<p>This spell wards the target and creates a mystic connection between you and the target so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. Casting this spell requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point. The target takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal Hit Point damage, and you take the amount of damage not taken by the target. Only Hit Point damage is transferred in this manner; the target&rsquo;s Stamina Points are damaged as normal. If you still have Stamina Points, you take the damage to your Stamina Points before Hit Points, as with normal damage.<br />Forms of harm that do not involve Hit Points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, ability drain, permanent negative levels, and death effects, are not affected. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the target and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the target. If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.</p>	2	null	null	abjuration	1 standard action	null	null	3	one creature	1 hour/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	377

While shrunken, the object takes up less space and bulk, but it ceases to function. When the spell ends, the object returns to normal size, moving through any nearby opening it can to reach a space that can accommodate it, but it does not expand with any force and does no harm to containers too small for it. This spell can affect objects of a size and bulk limited by the spell&rsquo;s level. Likewise, the spell&rsquo;s level determines the target&rsquo;s size after the spell takes effect. For this spell, vehicles and other objects without a specified weight count as an object with bulk equal to the number of squares of the object&rsquo;s space squared.<br /><strong>1st:</strong>&nbsp;You can target an object up to 1 cubic foot in size and weighing up to 10 bulk.

The target construct must have a CR lower than your level; if it does, the construct is convinced that you and your allies pose no threat. It can&rsquo;t take violent actions against you or your allies, and it can&rsquo;t do anything that would otherwise harm or threaten you (though it continues to carry out orders to take actions that do not harm or threaten you). Any aggressive action or damage dealt by you or your allies to a construct soothed in this way or its allies immediately ends this spell&rsquo;s effects (and could cause the construct to attack you, if it was doing so previously).<br />If an affected construct is under the control of a spellcaster or another creature, the controlling creature can spend a full action to remove soothing protocol, as long as it can either touch the construct or give it an order.</p>	null	4	null	enchantment	1 standard action	null	null	2	one construct with the technological subtype; see text	10 minutes/level	none	yes	CRB	377
348	Speak With Dead	<p>Corpse answers up to six questions.</p>	<p>You grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to answer questions. You can ask up to six questions. The corpse&rsquo;s knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you in life.<br />If the dead creature was friendly or helpful toward you in life, the spell works automatically. Otherwise, the corpse can attempt a Will saving throw to resist the spell as if it were alive. On a successful save, the corpse can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you using its Bluff skill. The target can speak only about what it knew in life. It can&rsquo;t answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after its death.<br />If the corpse has been subjected to speak with dead within the past week, this spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse might be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must have at least a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.</p>	3	null	3	necromancy (language-dependent)	10 minutes	null	null	13	one dead creature	1 minute/level	Will negates, see text	no	CRB	378
349	Spider Climb	<p>Grant ability to walk on walls and ceilings.</p>	<p>The target can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. An affected creature with four limbs must have three limbs free (not holding equipment or being used to perform skills and so on) to climb in this manner. A creature with six limbs needs only four available. In general, other creatures must have 75% of their limbs available to benefit from this spell. The target gains a climb speed of 20 feet (and the +8 racial bonus to Athletics checks to climb granted by that climb speed); furthermore, it doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt Athletics checks to climb to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). An affected creature climbing in this way is not flat-footed while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. The creature, however, can&rsquo;t use the run action while climbing.</p>	2	2	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	10 minutes/level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	378

Similarly, the off-kilter condition has no effect on the target while this spell is in effect.</p>	1	null	null	necromancy	1 standard action	null	null	3	one suit of armor	1 round/level	Will (harmless)	yes	COM	141

Once the spell has been cast upon the targets, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence.

355	Subjective Reality	<p>You convince yourself one creature or object is an illusion.</p>	<p>Choose one object or creature you can see within long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level). You alter your perceptions to become convinced the target is an illusion. For you, the target becomes transparent and does not create sound or smell. Until the spell ends, you can move through the target unimpeded and the target can move through you. The target&rsquo;s nonmagical attacks can&rsquo;t harm you, and the target&rsquo;s magical attacks deal half damage to you. The target&rsquo;s non-damaging magical abilities have only a 50% chance of affecting you, and you are immune to all its sonic, language-dependent, and scent-based attacks. However, your attacks deal no damage to the target, and your magical abilities don&rsquo;t affect the target at all. You or the target can affect each other normally through intermediaries. For instance, while the target would be immune to the direct effects of your charm monster spell, if you charmed another creature that then attacked the target creature, the target would not be immune to the damage from that attack.</p>	6	null	6	illusion (mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	1 round/level (D)	null	null	CRB	379
356	Suggestion	<p>Compel a target to follow stated course of action.</p>	<p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.<br />The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration of the spell. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the target finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, the activity is not performed.<br />A very reasonable suggestion imparts a penalty (such as &ndash;1 or &ndash;2) to the target&rsquo;s saving throw.</p>	3	null	3	enchantment (compulsion, language-dependent, mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	3	one living creature	1 hour/level or until completed	Will negates	yes	CRB	379

For example, for the 1st-level summon creature spell, you could choose Tiny air, earth, fire, and water elementals. Note that a particular alignment or class is sometimes required to choose certain creatures, as listed in Table 8. In place of a single selection, you can choose a creature from a lower-level summoning list; doing so allows you the option of summoning multiple such creatures at a time. Each time you gain a character level, you can change these selections.<br />You can gain summon creature a second time at the highest spell level you know, selecting four additional appropriate creatures at each level you can cast this spell.<br />You choose which of the selected creatures you summon each time you cast the spell.<br />1st: When you cast summon creature as a 1st-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 1st-level summoning list.<br />2nd: When you cast summon creature as a 2nd-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 2nd-level summoning list.

Creatures summoned using this spell can&rsquo;t use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that require expending Resolve Points or expensive materials to cast (such as raise dead).<br />To generate statistics for a summoned creature, first check the Stat Block column of Table 8: Summon Creature. If a page number is listed, use the creature&rsquo;s stat block on that page, though it is altered slightly depending on your alignment. Otherwise, if the entry is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or elder, use the elemental stat block of the same name and apply the appropriate graft, listed in the Applied Graft column. Non-elemental creatures lose elemental immunities and do not gain an elemental graft. For example, to get the statistics of an angel from the 1st-level list, you use the tiny elemental stat block and apply the angel summoning graft.</p>	1	1	1	conjuration (summoning)	1 round	one or more summoned creatures	null	4	null	1 round/level (D)	none	no	AA1	144

364	Summon Drift Beacons	<p>6th - Conjure Drift beacons to facilitate starship travel.</p>	<p>You conjure several Drift beacons into your current star system.

You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise, it lasts for 1 round per level.

371	Telekinesis	<p>Move an object, attack creatures, or hurl objects or creatures with your mind.</p>	<p>You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on your desired effect (choose one from below), the spell can perform a variety of combat maneuvers, provide a gentle, sustained force, or exert a single short, violent thrust.<br /><strong>Combat Maneuver:</strong>&nbsp;Once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a ranged attack that acts as a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip combat maneuver. Resolve these attempts as normal, but use your caster level plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. No saving throw is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating.<br /><strong>Sustained Force:</strong>&nbsp;A sustained force moves an object of no more than 25 pounds or 2 bulk per caster level up to 20 feet per round in any direction (including up or down). A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell lasts 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the spell&rsquo;s range.<br />You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand. For example, a lever can be pulled, a key turned, a button pushed, an object rotated, and so on if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though a delicate activity such as this requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.<br /><strong>Violent Thrust:</strong>&nbsp;The spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl up to 15 objects or creatures that are within range (no two of which can be more than 10 feet apart) toward any target within 150 feet of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 400 pounds or 40 bulk. You must make attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. All objects cause damage ranging from 1 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for less dangerous objects) to 1d10 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for extremely dangerous objects, such as weapons or bladed or spiked objects). Objects and creatures that miss the target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures that fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they can attempt Will saving throws (or rely on spell resistance) to negate the effect, as can those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a thrown creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes 1d6 damage as if it had fallen 10 feet.</p>	null	5	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	5	see text	concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text	none, Will negates (object), see text;	yes (object), see text	CRB	380

If you hit, you deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to both the target and the object.

373	Telepathic Bond	<p>Link allows allies to communicate.</p>	<p>You forge a telepathic bond between yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (or a modifier of &ndash;4 or higher). Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).<br />If desired, you can leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged.

This spell teleports you to a random, unoccupied square adjacent to the creature with which you have the telepathic bond. If no such square is available, you teleport to the closest eligible square; if the nearest eligible square is more than 50 feet away from the creature, this spell fails.<br />You can be transported any distance within a plane, even across the galaxy, but you can&rsquo;t travel between planes, and you can&rsquo;t transport yourself to a creature if one of you is traveling via Drift travel and the other isn&rsquo;t. In addition to yourself, you can transport any objects you carry as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You can also bring up to six additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (each carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. There must be sufficient space near the creature with which you have the telepathic bond for all the creatures you are teleporting, or this spell fails.</p>	6	null	null	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	2	you and touched objects and other touched willing or unconscious creatures	instantaneous	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	CRB	381

Any living creature within 10 feet of you or an intended recipient also receives your telepathic message if it succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check. You must be able to see or hear each recipient. The creatures that receive the message can reply telepathically, but no more than a single message can be sent each round, and each message cannot exceed 10 words. A technomancer casting this spell can also use it to send a message to a computer or a construct with the technological subtype if the receiving target is designed to receive messages.</p>	0	0	null	divination (language-dependent, mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	4	up to one creature/level	10 minutes/level	none	no	CRB	381

It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as speaking and listening to multiple people simultaneously. You can&rsquo;t use telepathy to locate creatures to communicate with them, but once you&rsquo;ve established telepathic communication, you don&rsquo;t require line of effect to maintain it.</p>	5	null	null	divination (mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	1	null	10 minute/level	null	null	CRB	381

Interplanar and interplanetary travel is not possible, and neither is travel between two moving starships during combat, though you might be able to teleport to a planet&rsquo;s surface from an orbiting starship. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum bulk limit. You can also bring up to five additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster, you need not attempt a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance.<br />You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult Table 10&ndash;1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br />Familiarity: &ldquo;Very familiar&rdquo; describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. &ldquo;Studied carefully&rdquo; describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you&rsquo;ve been there often. &ldquo;Seen casually&rdquo; describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. &ldquo;Viewed once&rdquo; describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can&rsquo;t teleport to an unknown location that you&rsquo;ve seen in a holovid).<br />&ldquo;False destination&rdquo; describes a place that doesn&rsquo;t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br />On Target: You appear where you want to be.<br />Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.<br />Similar Area: You wind up in an area that&rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell&rsquo;s range, the spell simply fails instead.<br />Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten &ldquo;scrambled.&rdquo; You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time &ldquo;mishap&rdquo; comes up, the creatures take more damage and must reroll.</p>	null	5	5	conjuration (teleportation)	1 standard action	null	null	20	you and touched objects and other touched willing or unconscious creatures	instantaneous	none, Will negates (object)	no, yes (object)	CRB	381
378	Terraform	<p>Alter terrain and climate.</p>	<p>You alter the area&rsquo;s terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert into plains. To cast this spell, you must spend 10 Resolve Points along with technological gear worth 30,000 credits (which is magically augmented to do much of the terraforming, then consumed by the spell). A xenodruid mystic instead uses crystals and incenses worth 30,000 credits. This magically alters the area&rsquo;s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but it doesn&rsquo;t affect creatures or the configuration of the ground. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but it doesn&rsquo;t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.<br />You can alter the climate by one step (cold, temperate, or warm). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general it changes to a similar terrain type or by one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on).<br />Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas.</p>	null	6	6	transmutation	1 hour	null	100-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	18	null	1 day/level; see text	none	no	CRB	382
379	Token Spell	<p>Perform simple magical effects.</p>	<p>Token spells are often some of the first minor changes that spellcasters produce when they begin experimenting with magic. Once cast, token spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. You can slowly lift one item of light bulk. You can alter items in a 1-foot cube each round, coloring, cleaning, soiling, cooling, warming, or flavoring them. You can create small objects, but they look artificial and are extremely fragile (they can&rsquo;t be used as tools or weapons). You can illuminate an object to shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.<br />Token spell lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists for only 1 hour.</p>	0	0	0	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	13	null	1 hour	none	yes	CRB	382
380	Tongues	<p>Target can speak and understand any language.</p>	<p>This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the spoken or signed language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The target can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the target to speak with creatures who don&rsquo;t speak. The target can make itself understood as far as its voice carries.</p>	3	3	3	divination	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	10 minutes/level	Will negates (harmless)	no	CRB	383
381	Transfer Charge	<p>Move charges from one power source to another source of the same type.</p>	<p>You can transfer any number of charges from one battery to another battery or from one power cell to another power cell. You can only transfer charges using two objects of the exact same type (two batteries of the same size, two identical power cells, or the like); you transfer charges from the source object to the receiving object.<br />You must declare how many charges you are transferring before casting this spell. If you transfer more charges from the source than the receiving item can hold, the receiving item must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 electricity damage. This spell provides no knowledge of how many charges a receiving item can safely hold, but you can choose to transfer fewer charges than the maximum allowed to reduce the risk.</p>	null	0	null	transmutation	1 standard action	null	null	2	two objects of the same type; see text	instantaneous	Fortitude negates (object)	yes (object)	CRB	383
382	Transfer Consciousness	<p>Transfer your mind into a computer or willing technological construct, and control its functions.</p>	<p>You transfer your mind into a computer or technological construct. If you transfer your mind into a computer, its tier can be no higher than half your caster level. If you transfer into a construct, it must be willing or, if nonsapient, not hostile to you. The construct&rsquo;s CR or level can be no higher than your caster level.<br />While your mind is in a computer system, you have direct control over its commands. You can perform Computers checks related to that system in half the usual time.<br />If you transfer your mind into a technological construct, you have access to its functions, allowing you to control the creature directly. You can&rsquo;t cast the construct&rsquo;s spells or use its spell-like or supernatural abilities. You can cast your own spells.<br />While this spell lasts, your body falls prone and helpless, as if you were unconscious. When the spell ends, your mind transfers back to your body instantly, provided your body and the target are on the same plane. Otherwise, you die.</p>	null	5	null	divination	1 round	null	null	2	one computer or willing technological construct; see text	10 minutes/level (D)	Will negates	yes	COM	142
383	Transport Passengers	<p>Create extradimensional seating space inside a vehicle or Tiny starship.</p>	<p>You create an extradimensional space in the passenger area of a vehicle or Tiny starship, allowing it to carry one additional Medium creature per caster level. This spell must be cast on a vehicle able to carry more than one passenger, or the spell fails. The extradimensional space appears in the vehicle&rsquo;s seating area or the starship&rsquo;s bridge or passenger section, and it looks like a thin, glowing gap in reality. Creatures that step through this gap are shunted into the extradimensional space, which appears to be and functions as another compartment in the vehicle. A creature can exit the extradimensional space as part of a move action to move through the gap in reality, though a creature cannot exit the extradimensional space unless room to accommodate it exists in the normal seating area.<br />Creatures that are encumbered or overburdened cannot enter the extradimensional space. If a creature is larger than Medium, each size category counts as one additional creature for determining the capacity of the extradimensional space.<br />Creatures within the extradimensional space can&rsquo;t interact with anything outside the vehicle, nor can creatures outside the vehicle perceive or interact with occupants and contents of the space. If the vehicle is destroyed or the extradimensional space is dispelled, the extradimensional space collapses. Anything within the extradimensional space when the vehicle or starship is destroyed, the space is dispelled, or this spell ends are shunted to the nearest open spaces outside the target.</p>	null	4	null	transmutation	1 minute	null	null	2	one vehicle or Tiny starship; see text	1 hour/level	none (object)	no (object)	COM	142
384	True Seeing	<p>Target can see things as they really are.</p>	<p>You confer upon the target the ability to see all things within 120 feet as they actually are. The target sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects that are invisible or displaced, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of changed or transmuted things. Further, the target can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces).<br />True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means.</p>	6	6	6	divination	1 standard action	null	null	2	one creature	1 minute/level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	CRB	383
385	Umbral Tendrils	<p>Assault a group of creatures with shadowy tentacles.</p>	<p>You summon a vision of a writhing mass of shadowy tendrils to assault creatures within 10 feet of the ground in the area. This area is difficul terrain. The first time a creature enters the area (including when the effect appears) on its turn, and each round the creature remains there, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and becomes entangled. If the tendrils are in dim light or darkness, the DC of the Will save increases by 2. A creature that succeeds at a Will saving throw halves the damage it takes and avoids becoming entangled. The same casting of this spell can&rsquo;t render such a creature entangled again. By succeeding at subsequent saves, such a creature reduces damage it takes from the same casting of the spell to one-quarter normal.</p>	3	null	null	illusion (shadow)	1 standard action	null	20-ft.-radius spread	4	null	1 round + 1 round/3 levels (D)	Will half, see text	yes	SS3	53
386	Unseen Servant	<p>Invisible force obeys your commands.</p>	<p>The spell conjures an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command (a move action). It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift up to 20 pounds or 2 bulk or drag up to 100 pounds or 10 bulk). It can trigger traps and such, but it can&rsquo;t exert enough force to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can&rsquo;t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can&rsquo;t be used untrained. This servant can&rsquo;t fly, climb, or swim (though it can walk on water). Its land speed is 15 feet.<br />The servant can&rsquo;t attack in any way; it is never allowed to make attack rolls. It can&rsquo;t be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 or more damage from area attacks; it gets no saving throws against attacks.</p>	null	1	null	conjuration (creation)	1 standard action	one invisible, mindless, shapeless servant	null	3	null	1 hour/level	none	no	CRB	383
387	Unspeakable Presences	<p>Enemies in the area take 4d6 damage per round, cannot move, and might be devoured whole.</p>	<p>You swap the space beneath your enemies with the gnashing maws, tentacles, and claws of hideous beasts from another reality. A foe in the area takes 4d6 damage per round and cannot move until it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw, which it can attempt at the end of each of its turns. At that point, the opponent can be affected again only if it leaves the spell&rsquo;s area and then returns.<br />A creature that takes damage from this spell 3 rounds in a row must succeed at a Fortitude save or be consumed by the unspeakable presences. That creature dies, and when the spell ends, its body and gear disappear into the realities from whence the presences came. This is a death effect. Only miracle, warp reality, and wish can bring back a creature slain this way.</p>	null	null	6	transmutation	1 standard action	null	60-ft. radius	5	null	1 round/level (D)	none; see text	no	COM	142
388	Unwilling Guardian	<p>Charm a target into protecting you during combat.</p>	<p>Your overwhelming presence bores into the target&rsquo;s mind, cowing its will. This turns it into an automaton-like guardian that protects you at all costs. As soon as it is able, the target mindlessly moves along the most direct route toward you and stops when it is within 10 feet of you (provoking attacks of opportunity for movement as normal). If you are being attacked in melee by a creature within 10 feet, the target instead takes the quickest route to intercept that creature from a square within 10 feet of you and attack it on your behalf.<br />While this spell is in effect, the target attacks any creature that attacks you in melee, though it can&rsquo;t move more than 10 feet from you to do so. If multiple creatures are attacking you in melee, you can choose which creature the target attacks on your behalf as part of combat banter. If you are the target of ranged attacks and your guardian is not attacking a melee assailant on your behalf, it moves to provide cover against the ranged attacks. Due to the strong momentary connection between you and your unwilling guardian, if you are the single target of a hostile creature&rsquo;s spell or effect, the creature must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 6 + your caster level) or the spell or effect instead targets your guardian. This spell has no effect on area of effect or multi-target spells or other effects that include you as a target.<br />When this spell ends, the target regains control of its faculties entirely and it knows and remembers that you used magic to control it. Once a creature has been the target of unwilling guardian, it can&rsquo;t be targeted with this spell again for 24 hours if cast by the same spellcaster.</p>	null	5	5	enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting)	1 standard action	null	null	3	one creature with CR lower than your level; see text	1 round/level (D)	Will negates	yes	CRB	383
389	Usher Apocalypse	<p>Deal fire damage, create difficult terrain, and potentially anchor foes to the ground in the area.</p>	<p>You create a quasi-real apocalypse to tear through the area, causing several effects. When the spell first takes effect, illusory hellfire crashes to the ground, dealing 6d6 fire damage to your enemies in the area. Creatures can attempt a Will saving throw to disbelieve the fiery vision and take only half damage.<br />Then, for the duration, two more effects continue. An illusion makes the ground appear to be unstable crust over lava, which your foes treat as difficult terrain. Grasping hands appear to reach out from the ground to grab at enemies. Each time an enemy starts its turn in the area, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be unable to leave its space for the turn.</p>	null	null	6	illusion (shadow)	1 standard action	null	60-ft. radius	5	null	1 round/level (D)	Will disbelief and Reflex partial; see text	yes	COM	142
390	Veil	<p>Change appearance of a group of creatures.</p>	<p>You instantly change the appearance of the targets and then maintain that appearance for the spell&rsquo;s duration. You can make the targets appear to be anything you wish. The targets look, feel, and smell just like what the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures return to their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed at a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus to such a check (since it counts as altering your form).<br />An unwilling target can negate the spell&rsquo;s effect on it by succeeding at a Will saving throw or by relying on spell resistance. Those who interact with the targets can attempt Will saving throws to disbelieve the illusion, but spell resistance doesn&rsquo;t help pierce the illusion.</p>	null	6	6	illusion	1 standard action	null	null	5	up to one or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	concentration + 1 hour/level (D)	Will negates or disbelief, see text	yes, see text	CRB	384

A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.<br />For both this and the dormant growth effect (see below), the plant matter explodes from the targeted device, filling all squares within a 20-foot-radius spread. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 slashing damage and is entangled; on a successful save, it takes half damage, isn&rsquo;t entangled, and is shunted to the nearest empty space available. A square of plant matter has hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. The growth also covers the device, preventing non-remote access until the plant matter is destroyed or disintegrates at the end of the spell&rsquo;s duration.<br /><strong>Dormant Growth:</strong>&nbsp;You implant verdant code into an computer system or module you have root access to. The next time the device is accessed, plant matter explodes from the device (see above). A device can hold only one instance of verdant code at a time, and new instances erase the previous instance. If this spell&rsquo;s duration ends before the implanted code is accessed, the code vanishes. This code can be made permanent, as implant data.</p>	null	1	1	conjuration	1 standard action	null	null	3	one computer system or module	1 hour/level or until triggered, then 1 minute/level, see text	Will negates (object), Reflex partial, see text	yes (object), see text	NSP	129
393	Vigilant Junkbot	<p>Create a temporary robot made of junk that can protect you from ranged or melee attacks.</p>	<p>You turn the target into a robot that can guard you. This spell works like handy junkbot insofar as targeting parameters and your inability to target the same equipment after the spell ends. The junkbot you create is Tiny and appears in your space.<br />A vigilant junkbot can take no actions. Instead, you instruct the junkbot to perform its melee protocol or ranged protocol. You can change the protocol telepathically as a move action. In its melee protocol, the junkbot attaches to you, granting you a +1 bonus to KAC for every 4 technomancer levels you have. In its ranged protocol, the vigilant junkbot hovers at strategic angles to cover you, granting you concealment against ranged attacks. Additionally, when you take damage from an attack that matches the protocol (melee or ranged), the junkbot takes the first 3 damage. Any additional damage passes to you.<br />Enemies can target the junkbot instead of you. Its KAC and EAC are each 10 + your caster level, and it has Hit Points equal to one-quarter of your own (but no Stamina Points). The junkbot uses your saving throw bonuses, and it is a construct with the magical and technological subtypes.</p>	null	2	null	transmutation	1 round	null	null	2	1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text	1 round/level	none	no	COM	143
394	Viral Destruction	<p>Create a virus in a recently dead body, allowing it to strike again and potentially spread the virus further.</p>	<p>You can cast this spell only immediately after a creature in range dies. On its next turn in the initiative order, the corpse stands up (if applicable; this does not require a move action), can take a single move action to move up to its speed, and makes a single attack using the weapons and bonuses it had when alive (though it can&rsquo;t use class features, spell-like abilities, or spells). You can choose the target of the affected creature&rsquo;s attack or allow the target corpse to select a target entirely at random. If the target of this spell was friendly or helpful toward you in life, the spell works automatically; otherwise, the corpse can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this spell, as if the creature were still alive.<br />After making its attack, the creature that you have targeted with viral destruction falls and is dead as normal. However, if this attack kills the affected creature&rsquo;s target or if it knocks it unconscious, that target must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the spell&rsquo;s DC) or be subject to viral destruction and make a single attack on its next turn before returning to its normal dead or unconscious state. If the secondary target of viral destruction is merely unconscious and becomes conscious again before its next action, that creature is freed from the viral destruction effect and the spell ends. Each attack caused by this spell can transfer the viral destruction effect to its target if that target is knocked unconscious or killed by the attack, until the spell has affected a number of creatures equal to your mystic level.</p>	3	null	null	necromancy	1 reaction	null	null	3	one newly dead creature; see text	instantaneous; see text	Will negates, see text	yes	DS02	51
395	Vision	<p>Answer a question about a person, place, or object.</p>	<p>You pose a question about some person, place, or object while casting this spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question and you succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, DC 20), you receive a vision about that person, place, or object. The information gained includes everything available about the target that could be discovered by spending weeks in dedicated research with excellent-quality but standard reference works.<br />If the person or object is not at hand or you are not in the place and you know only detailed information about the person, place, or object, the DC of the caster level check is 25 and the information gained is incomplete (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better vision result next time). If you know only rumors, the DC is 30 and the information gained is vague (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better vision result next time). In most circumstances, you can&rsquo;t glean information about what occurred during the Gap with this spell.<br />Casting this spell requires access to a computer or similar device, which displays the information gained.

One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each subsequent round. In addition, the wall deals 5d6 fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.<br />If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.

397	Wall of Force	<p>Invisible wall is difficult to destroy.</p>	<p>Wall of force creates an invisible wall of pure force. You can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.<br />This counts as a force field for effects that can&rsquo;t penetrate a force field. The wall can&rsquo;t move and is not easily destroyed. A wall of force is immune to dispel magic. A greater dispel magic specifically targeting the wall of force can dispel it, but treat the wall of force&rsquo;s caster level as being 5 higher than the actual caster level. A wall of force can be damaged by spells and attacks as normal, but a wall of force has hardness 30 and 300 Hit Points. Disintegrate instantly destroys a wall of force.<br />Breath weapons and spells can&rsquo;t pass through a wall of force in either direction, though dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. The wall blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall by going around it, through material floors and ceilings).

The stress of casting this spell requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point. The wall can fit into any space of surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall can&rsquo;t be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.<br />A wall of steel is 4 inches thick. You can double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 15 and 45 Hit Points per inch of thickness. A section of wall that is reduced to 0 Hit Points is breached. The DC of the Strength check for a creature to break through the wall with a single attack is 30. The wall is firmly anchored to its surroundings, and it doesn&rsquo;t easily tip over; it can&rsquo;t be summoned into any area where it is likely to fall or collapse.<br />Like any steel wall, this wall is subject to perforation and other natural phenomena, though it doesn&rsquo;t rust or corrode under typical circumstances.
