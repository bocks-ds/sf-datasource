8	Urban Cruiser	2	<p>Some vehicles have autocontrol, which enables you to spend your actions on tasks other than piloting, but is far less capable than an autopilot. You can engage autocontrol as a swift action after taking a drive or race action, and it lasts until it is disengaged (also a swift action) or until the vehicle is no longer capable of moving. When you’re using autocontrol, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled, but each round it moves in a straight line for the same distance and at the same heading and speed as the last pilot action (moving as if taking two drive actions if drive was the last action the pilot took, or as a race action if that was the last action the pilot took).

13	Police Cruiser	4	<p>Some vehicles have an autopilot AI that can control the vehicle in place of an actual pilot. You can engage or disengage an autopilot as a swift action. You can input a destination into an autopilot as a move action, and the autopilot attempts to reach that location if doing so is possible (provided the autopilot isn’t locked by a passcode or otherwise programmed not to obey).<br/> A vehicle is considered controlled when the autopilot is engaged. An autopilot’s actions are dictated by the GM, and an autopilot can take any of the actions to pilot the vehicle that an actual pilot can. However, autopilots tend to be cautious, rarely risking the integrity of the vehicle and never attempting to ram or run over a target unless specifically programmed as a war machine (indicated in its stat block).<br/> The Systems entry in a vehicle’s statistics lists the autopilot’s modifier to the Piloting skill. For Piloting checks attempted for the Autopilot, apply this modifier first and then apply the vehicle’s modifier (listed in the vehicle’s Modifiers entry) to the Piloting checks.</p>	6195	Large land and air vehicle	75 mph (ground and fly)	75	null	75	null	null	null	null	3	CRB	229

As a result, they deal very little damage if they ram a target, and jumping off one causes no damage beyond falling damage, because the hoverbike has no effective momentum.</p>	20000	Large land and air vehicle	65 mph (hover and fly)	null	65	65	null	null	null	null	1	DS05	41

46	Protector Chariot	12	<p>A Protector chariot is a hybrid vehicle with a virtual intelligence. In its neutral form, the vehicle is a dense, 10-foot-diameter sphere of mercury-like metal. This malleable form can reshape to replicate almost any vehicle of similar size. However, only someone who has the Protector of Kahlannal feat can pilot one of these chariots. When chariots are adjacent to one another, the pilots can command the vehicles to combine and form a larger vehicle. Four chariots in proximity can combine to form a vessel of starship scale, called an Accord (see the inside covers).<br> When a pilot wishes to enter a chariot, they touch the surface and telepathically command the vehicle to allow them inside. The chariot surface envelops the pilot, pulling them within. When the vehicle reconfigures, it moves the pilot into a new position suited to piloting the chariot’s new form.<br> Once the anassanois integrate with Pact Worlds societies, vehicles similar to chariots might appear on the open market. However, such knockoffs don’t come from the anassanois, who would see such replicas as bordering on sacrilegious.</br></br></p>	120000	Large land, air, and water vehicle	65 mph (hover and fly)	null	65	65	null	null	null	null	3	DF05	44
