Bayonet bracket, heavy	<p>A bayonet bracket allows you to attach a one-handed melee weapon to the bottom rail of a railed weapon or a small arm. The melee weapon cannot have the reach weapon special property. Attaching a melee weapon to a bayonet bracket or removing it is a full action. If the attached melee weapon deals bludgeoning or slashing damage, you take a –2 penalty to attack rolls with it while it’s attached. The type of bayonet bracket determines which weapons you can use together.</p>	1	300	null	0	null	Railed weapon	ARM	58
Bayonet bracket, light	<p>A bayonet bracket allows you to attach a one-handed melee weapon to the bottom rail of a railed weapon or a small arm. The melee weapon cannot have the reach weapon special property. Attaching a melee weapon to a bayonet bracket or removing it is a full action. If the attached melee weapon deals bludgeoning or slashing damage, you take a –2 penalty to attack rolls with it while it’s attached.

Bipod, light	<p>A bipod is a set of sturdy legs attached to a railed weapon’s bottom rail. You can extend or collapse a bipod as a move action. Also as a move action, you can stabilize your weapon by resting an extended bipod on a solid surface or using the bipod as a forward grip. When you fire the stabilized weapon, reduce the total penalty you take for making a full attack and due to range according to the bipod’s type. You can’t benefit from a bipod if your weapon is mounted to a gunner harness (see page 60) or powered armor.</p>	1	350	null	0	null	Railed weapon	ARM	58
Grenadier bracket	<p>A grenadier bracket allows you to attach a modified grenade launcher or missile launcher of 3 bulk or less to the bottom rail of a railed weapon. The modifications reduce the capacity of the grenade launcher or missile launcher by 50%, to a minimum of 1 grenade or missile. These modifications can be made in 1 hour with a DC 15 Engineering check, though it is also possible to buy bracket-ready grenade or missile launchers that have been premodified for the same price as standard grenade and missile launchers. Such a modified grenade or missile launcher can still be fired as a separate weapon, and still uses proficiency in heavy weapons, even if fired from a rail on a longarm or other weapon. Attaching a grenade launcher to a grenadier bracket or removing it is a full action.</p>	1	400	L	0	null	Railed weapon	ARM	59
Rangefinder	<p>A rangefinder pulses a laser at distant targets to determine their distance from you. As a move action, you can activate or deactivate a rangefinder and aim it at a specific target. The rangefinder determines the target’s range from you and its speed, and tells you whether the target is moving away from or toward you.<br/> You can use a rangefinder when it is not attached to or integrated with a weapon, as well. You can combine a rangefinder with a scope or sight (see Scope below or Sight on page 61) by paying the combined price of the accessories. Their benefits stack.</p>	1	325	null	20	1/hour	Railed weapon, small arm	ARM	60
Uniclamp	<p>This all-purpose accessory can hold a single handheld item of up to 1 bulk, such as a fire extinguisher or flashlight, so you can use the item while wielding the weapon. A uniclamp requires as many rails to attach to a piece of equipment as the equipment requires hands to operate. Attaching an item to a uniclamp or removing it is a full action.<br/> Unlike a <i><a href="https://thehiddentruth.info/player/equipment/items/personal?page=Gearclamp">gear clamp</a></i>, which merely places an object in some convenient location (such as on your armor or clamped to a strut), but has no ability to activate or deactivate items clamped to it, a uniclamp runs any necessary controls for the item to the trigger or control mechanism for the weapon it is attached to. This allows you to use the item as if manipulating it with the same number of hands you have on your weapon, while still wielding the weapon. For example if you use a uniclamp to attach a beacon portable light onto a thunderstrike streetsweeper, you can turn the beacon on and off while still keeping two hands on your streetsweeper.<br/> The GM can rule that some items are unsuited for use with a uniclamp, that a uniclamp can be attached to only some weapons, or that a uniclamp designed for particular items doesn't work with anything else.</p>	1	150	null	0	null	Railed weapon	ARM	61

Sight, manual	<p>A sight is an improved version of the common targeting sights used by most ranged weapons. It may be a loop with an incorporated reticle, or a series of guidelines with high-visibility pigment on them, or some other simple design aid to aiming your weapon. A sight attaches to a small arm or railed weapon’s top rail. A sight can’t be added to a weapon with a scope (see page 60). As a move action, you can aim through a sight. This can be done as part of the same move action as is required to aim a weapon with the sniper weapon special quality, or as part of a sneak attack where you do not take any movement even if you also aim a sniper weapon as part of that action. Aiming through a sight reduces penalties to attack rolls due to range or bonuses to AC from cover, depending on the sight’s type. The reduction in penalties due to aiming with a sight applies only to the next attack roll you make with the weapon before the end of your next turn.</p>	2	1000	null	0	null	Railed weapon, small arm	ARM	61
Stock, collapsing	<p>A stock is a part of a two-handed ranged weapon that rests against the shoulder during firing. A stock cannot be attached; it must be integrated with a weapon. The benefits of a stock depend on its type.</p>	2	850	null	0	null	Railed weapon	ARM	61
Collapsing weapon	<p>Some melee weapons can be made to collapse for easy and inconspicuous storage. A weapon must be purchased or crafted with this accessory integrated. As a move action, you can fold or close a collapsing weapon into a much smaller size, allowing you to use the Sleight of Hand skill to hide a collapsed weapon of 1 or 2 bulk as if it were a light weapon, or granting a collapsed weapon of light bulk the conceal special property (see page 27). As a move action, you can re-extend a collapsed weapon.</p>	3	1250	null	0	null	Melee weapon	ARM	59
Flash suppressor	<p>Modern projectile weapons have built-in flash and muzzle-blast suppression to protect a weapon’s user from flash blinding during firefights in low-light conditions, as well as to protect other high-tech devices from fouling due to residue from projectile accelerants. A hybrid flash suppressor can be added to any small arm, longarm, heavy weapon, or sniper weapon in the projectile category. It eliminates virtually all light and heat that your projectile weapon produces while firing, making you harder to spot in low-light conditions. This benefit reduces the penalty you take to Stealth checks for sniping in low-light conditions by 5.<br/> You can combine a flash suppressor and silencer (see page 61) together by paying the combined price of both accessories. Their benefits stack.</p>	3	1200	null	0	null	Projectile	ARM	59
Gunner harness, light	<p>A gunner harness is a wearable support mesh for an articulated arm that can serve as a mount for a heavy weapon. A gunner harness reduces the minimum Strength score required to fire a heavy weapon without penalty, as determined by the harness’s type. In addition, when you fire the mounted weapon, reduce the total penalty you take for making a full attack and due to range by a value determined by the harness’s type. Donning or removing a gunner harness is a full action, and attaching a weapon to a gunner harness or removing it is a full action.</p>	3	1400	1	0	null	Heavy weapon	ARM	60
Scope, sniper	<p>A scope is a telescopic sighting device with an incorporated reticle that attaches to a small arm or railed weapon’s top rail. A scope can’t be added to a weapon with a sight (see page 61). As a move action, you can aim through a scope. This can be done as part of the same move action required to aim a weapon with the sniper weapon special quality, or as part of a sneak attack where you do not take any movement even if you also aim a sniper weapon as part of that action. Aiming through a scope reduces penalties to attack rolls due to range as well as bonuses to AC from cover.<br/> In addition, a scope increases a weapon’s range increment for determining penalties to attack rolls due to range. For small arms, a scope increases the weapon’s normal range increment to 1-1/2 times its listed range for this purpose. For longarms and heavy weapons, the increase is 4 times the normal range increment. For sniper weapons, the increase is twice the range increment of the sniper special property. The reduction in penalties due to aiming with a scope applies only to the next attack roll you make with the weapon before the end of your next turn. Scopes also confer other benefits depending on their type.<br/> You can also view distant objects through a scope as a move action, which grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to vision-based Perception checks against objects 30 feet or farther from you. You can use a scope for this purpose when it is not attached to or integrated with a weapon. A detached scope does not provide improved accuracy.</p>	3	1350	L	0	null	Railed weapon, small arm	ARM	60

Silencer	<p>Similar to flash suppression, modern weapons have sound-suppression hardware built in to protect users and bystanders from high-decibel reports, but this doesn’t make a weapon silent. A hybrid silencer uses magitech to truly silence a weapon. When you fire a weapon equipped with a silencer, the weapon creates no sound, and its ammunition flies silently for the first range increment (this includes the range increment of a weapon with the sniper special property). This benefit reduces the penalty you take to Stealth checks for sniping by 5.<br/> You can combine a silencer and flash suppressor (see page 59) together by paying the combined price of both accessories.
