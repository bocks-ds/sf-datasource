Abysium	<p>Abysium, also called feverstone, is a radioactive metal distinguished by its blue-green glow. It is believed to form when asteroids transmute, in part, into abysium in the darkness of space where boundaries between the Material Plane and the Abyss are thin. Abysium can be used as a power source, and it is sometimes used in higher-capacity batteries.<br/> Weapons and ammunition fashioned from abysium emanate low radiation (Core Rulebook 403) in a spherical area equal to the space of the intended wielder—Medium and Small weapons have a radius of 5 feet, Large weapons have a radius of 10 feet, and so on. Weapons and ammunition fashioned from abysium gain the bright weapon special property, as well as a critical hit effect that inflicts the sickened condition; the target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate this poison effect, which otherwise lasts 1d4 rounds. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the sickened effect.<br/> If a melee weapon that has the powered weapon special property is made from abysium, reduce its usage by 1. If the weapon has a usage of 1, increase its usage to up to 2 minutes of operation (rather than the normal 1 minute). This aspect of abysium can be applied to melee weapons that deal only energy damage (though not solarian weapon crystals of any type).</p>	Ammunition (1 piece)	70	ARM	66

Adamantine Alloy	<p>Adamantine is a starmetal, one of several valuable metals mined from asteroids and planets throughout the universe. Pure adamantine is exceedingly rare and expensive, so weapons using adamantine are always made of an adamantine alloy. Weapons or ammunition fashioned from adamantine alloy overcome the damage reduction of creatures with DR/adamantine, such as many magical constructs, and have a natural ability to ignore hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 30 (see Breaking Objects on page 409). Weapons and ammunition without metal parts can’t be made from adamantine alloy. This metal can be fashioned into threads and incorporated into the composite material of any armor.

Djezet	<p>Djezet is a rust-red liquid and is among the most common of starmetals. Scientists have found no temperature at which this starmetal becomes solid in its pure form. It reacts strongly to magic, guiding eldritch energy much as copper guides electric currents. Crafters use djezet frequently in hybrid items and magic items. Items incorporating djezet are usually made with an alloy using djezet and steel.<br/> Any weapon with metal components, even those that deal only energy damage, can be made of djezet alloy. Such a weapon is considered to be 2 item levels lower when determining which fusion seals can be applied to the weapon, but it is considered to be 2 item levels higher when determining the total level of fusions that can be applied to the weapon.<br/> If djezet is properly incorporated into a hybrid or magic item, the saving throw DC for magical effects that item creates increases by 2. This increase also applies to magical effects created by weapons. Djezet can also be worked into armor composites. If you wear djezet-enhanced armor, you act as if your caster level were 1 higher for determining the range and duration of your spells, and for caster level checks. If you can’t cast spells, djezet-laced armor provides no benefit to you.</p>	Armor	2000	ARM	66

Horacalcum	<p>Horacalcum, the rarest starmetal, has a dull copper color and warps space-time around itself on a quantum level. For this reason, horacalcum is a component for stasis chambers and other items that halt, reverse, or rewind the aging process. Some technomancers theorize that horacalcum might hold the key to using magic to unlock and command the flow of time.<br/> Weapons or ammunition fashioned from horacalcum temporarily distort time’s flow for enemies struck, causing the staggered critical hit effect. A melee weapon made of horacalcum that already has the staggered critical hit effect increases its save DC by 2, as does a weapon firing ammunition made of the metal. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, choose each time whether to apply the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the staggered effect.<br/> Horacalcum can also be spun into metallic fiber and interwoven with armor. Armor modified with horacalcum grants you a +1 enhancement bonus to initiative checks and a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against effects that would inflict the staggered condition.</p>	Ammunition (1 piece)	70	ARM	66

Inubrix	<p>Nicknamed “ghost iron”, inubrix is the softest of the starmetals. Due to the metal’s unique structure, inubrix molecules can realign to pass through submolecular spaces in denser materials. Inubrix sees use in complex machinery, especially in collapsible or miniaturized technologies. In its pure form, inubrix is too soft to function as a building material. Items using inubrix are made of an alloy of inubrix and another metal, often platinum, the dense molecular structure of the latter serving to anchor the former in place.<br/> Inubrix alloy weapons and ammunition ignore hardness of 10 or less. If a critical hit effect from an inubrix weapon requires a saving throw, the save DC increases by 2. This increase also applies to the injection DC +2 critical hit effect, provided the weapon doing the injecting, such as the dart of a needler pistol, is made of inubrix. A melee weapon made of inubrix alloy can also pass slightly into other solid objects, giving the wielder extra leverage for disarm attempts; this advantage grants a melee weapon made of inubrix alloy the disarm special property.</p>	Ammunition (1 piece)	50	ARM	67

Siccatite	<p>Siccatite is a shining silver metal that is extremely resilient to thermal energy. When found naturally, it is incredibly cold until exposed to extreme heat, at which point it becomes incredibly hot. The process for switching siccatite between these two states is difficult; hot siccatite must be quenched in temperatures of –250º F or colder for at least 24 hours, while cold siccatite must be heated in temperatures of 5,000º F or hotter for at least 24 hours. Objects formed completely of siccatite are immune to cold damage and fire damage, making them crucial components in items that are in constant contact with severe heat or cold.<br/> A weapon made of cold siccatite that deals cold damage, whether inherently or from a weapon fusion, deals 1 extra cold damage plus 1 extra cold damage per 6 item levels, up to +4 at 18th level. A weapon made of hot siccatite that deals fire damage gains the same amount of extra fire damage.<br/> When a siccatite weapon is used in combat, the siccatite molecules become excited and radiate the starmetal’s associated energy type. If you wield a hot siccatite weapon, you take 1 fire damage when you hit a target with the weapon. Similarly, a cold siccatite weapon you wield deals you 1 cold damage when you hit with it. You take this damage only once per round.<br/> Ammunition isn’t made of siccatite, as it tends to damage a weapon made of other materials and doesn’t provide additional benefits if used with a weapon already made of siccatite.<br/> The temperature of pure siccatite makes it unsuitable as the sole material for wearable items for most species. However, armor can have siccatite as part of its composite material. Wearing armor that is integrated with siccatite provides you cold and fire resistance 3.</p>	Armor	2500	ARM	67
