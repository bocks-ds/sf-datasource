name	description
Aeon	<p>A weapon that has the aeon special property includes a socket that can house an aeon stone. As a standard action, you can slot an aeon stone into the socket or remove it. You can slot an aeon stone into a weapon only if the weapon has an item level equal to or greater than the aeon stone’s item level. You don’t benefit from the stone’s normal abilities while the stone is slotted into a weapon. Instead, an aeon weapon with a slotted aeon stone gains the boost weapon special property, provided it doesn’t have the blast or unwieldy properties. The amount of the boost’s damage increase is dependent on the item level of the slotted aeon stone, as follows: level 1–5, 1d4; levels 6–10, 1d6; levels 11–15, 1d8; levels 16–20, 1d10.<br/>A slotted aeon stone has a number of charges per day equal to the stone’s item level. Utilizing the boost special property the stone provides spends charges from the stone equal to the weapon’s usage value. If the stone lacks enough charges, the boost attempt has no effect. An aeon stone that has had any daily charges expended in this way turns a dull color and doesn’t confer its usual benefits if removed from the aeon weapon.</p>
Analog	<p>This weapon does not use any advanced electronics, computer systems, or electrical power sources. It is immune to abilities that target technology. While this use of the word “analog” is not technically correct when referring to technology, use of the term in this way has become common throughout the Pact Worlds.</p>
Antibiological	<p>An antibiological weapon damages only living targets. Objectsand creatures with the unliving special quality, such as robotsand undead, are immune to its effects.</p>
Archaic	<p>This weapon deals 5 fewer damage unless the target is wearing no armor or archaic armor. Archaic weapons are made of primitive materials such as wood or common steel.</p>
Aurora	<p>When an aurora weapon strikes a target, the creature glows witha soft luminescence for 1 minute. This negates invisibility effectsand makes it impossible for the target to gain concealment fromor hide in areas of shadow or darkness.</p>
Automatic	<p>In addition to making ranged attacks normally, a weapon with this special property can fire in fully automatic mode. No action is required to toggle a weapon between making normal ranged attacks and using automatic mode.<br/>When you make a full attack with a weapon in automatic mode, you can attack in a cone with a range of half the weapon’s range increment. This uses all the weapon’s remaining ammunition. Roll one attack against each target in the cone, starting with those closest to you. Attacks made with a weapon in automatic mode can’t score critical hits. Roll damage only once, and apply it to all targets struck. Each attack against an individual creature in the cone uses up the same amount of ammunition or charges as taking two shots, and once you no longer have enough ammunition to attack another target, you stop making attacks.<br/>For example, if you were using a tactical X-gen gun with 27 rounds remaining, you would target the nearest 6 creatures in the cone and use up all 27 rounds.<br/>If more than one creature is equidistant and you don’t have enough cartridges remaining to shoot at all equidistant creatures, determine randomly which one you target. You can’t avoid shooting at allies in the cone, nor can you shoot any creature more than once, even if you have enough cartridges to fire more shots than you have targets. Attacks in automatic mode take the same penalties as other full attacks.</p>
Blast	<p>This weapon fires in a cone that extends only to its first range increment. You can’t use it to attack creatures beyond that range.<br/>For each attack you make with a weapon with the blast special property, roll one attack against each target in the cone, starting with those closest to you. Each attack takes a –2 penalty in addition to other penalties, such as the penalty to all attacks during a full attack. Roll damage only once for all targets. If you roll one or more critical hits, roll the extra critical damage only once (or any other special effects on a critical hit that require you to roll) and apply it to each creature against which you score a critical hit. You can’t avoid shooting at allies in the cone, nor can you shoot any creature more than once.<br/>Attacks with blast weapons ignore concealment. A blast weapon doesn’t benefit from feats or abilities that increase the damage of a single attack (such as the operative’s trick attack). Ammunition for blast weapons is designed for blast attacks, so you spend the usage amount only once for each cone of attacks.</p>
Block	<p>Only melee weapons can have the block special property, which represents some kind of guard or crossbar that can protect you from attacks by a foe you strike in melee. When you successfully strike a target with a melee attack using such a weapon, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC for 1 round against melee attacks from that target.</p>
Boost	<p>You can charge up a weapon with this special property as a move action. When you do, you increase the weapon’s damage by the listed amount on the next attack you make with the weapon. Boosting expends charges from the weapon equal to its usage value. This increases the weapon’s damage and is multiplied on a critical hit. Boosting a weapon more than once before firing it doesn’t have any extra effect, and the extra charge dissipates if the weapon is not fired by the end of your next turn.</p>
Breach	<p>A breach weapon is specifically designed to apply sudden forceto doors and walls in an effort to break them. If you are trainedin Engineering, as a full action you can use a breach weaponagainst an adjacent stationary door or wall, or at the GM’sdiscretion, against a similar adjacent object. An attack with theweapon expends ammunition as normal, but instead of makingan attack roll, you attempt a Strength check against the object’sbreak DC (Core Rulebook 408) and add the breach weapon’sitem level to the check.</p>
Breakdown	<p>A breakdown weapon can be taken apart into multiplesmall pieces. While broken down, the weapon is treated asespecially small or easy to hide for the purpose of Sleightof Hand’s hide object task and can fit into spaces that cantypically hold only items of light bulk (including a ysoki’scheek pouches). It takes 1 minute to take apart or reassemblea breakdown weapon.</p>
Bright	<p>Attacks with bright weapons illuminate the area within 20 feet of you and your target for 1 round following the attack, increasing the illumination level by one step, to a maximum of normal light.</p>
Cluster	<p>A cluster weapon is a form of grenade launcher that can firea single grenade or (if loaded with appropriate grenades) canexpend two identical grenades as a single attack. In the lattercase, the grenades act as a single grenade of the same type(with a single attack roll, dealing damage only once, and so on),except its radius is increased by the listed amount listed and thesave DC of any effects created by the grenade is calculated usingthe cluster weapon’s item level if it is higher than the grenade’sitem level. Attempting to fire two nonidentical grenades resultsin an error code and the weapon does not fire.</p>
Conceal	<p>A weapon with the conceal special property is consideredespecially small or easy to hide for purposes of Slight of Hand’shide object task, granting you a +4 circumstance bonus to skillchecks to hide object.</p>
Deconstruct	<p>The target of a weapon with the deconstruct special propertytakes the listed amount of acid damage every round untilthe target succeeds at a Reflex save to end the damage. Thisfunctions as the burning condition, except as noted and that theongoing damage is also ended if the target takes any amount ofelectricity damage.</p>
Deflect	<p>A weapon with the deflect special property generates both anenergy and a kinetic effect, which allows you to use it with theDeflect Projectiles feat (if you have it) to counter both kineticand energy ranged attacks.</p>
Disarm	<p>When you attempt a disarm combat maneuver while wielding a weapon with the disarm special property, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll.</p>
Double	<p>A double weapon has two different weapons placed end toend so you can attack with either easily without changingyour grip. For the purpose of the Multi-Weapon Fighting feat,a double weapon is treated as two or more operative meleeweapons. A double weapon is not treated as an operativeweapon for any other purpose unless it has the operativeweapon special property.<br/>Some double weapons have ends that deal different damagetypes. When making a single attack with such a weapon, you canchoose which damage type to deal, but if you make more thanone attack in the same round, at least one of those attacks mustbe made with the second damage type. The weapon categoryof a double weapon that deals more than one damage type isbased on the first damage type listed. If its second damage typecauses it to be considered a different weapon category whendealing that damage, that category is listed in parentheses. Forexample, a double weapon in the flame category that deals 1d6fire damage or 1d6 cold damage lists “double (cryo)” to indicatethat when it is used to deal cold damage, it is treated as aweapon in the cryo category.</p>
Drain Charge	<p>When a weapon with the drain charge weapon special propertyhits an enemy that has a natural attack that deals electricitydamage (an attack not dependent on armor upgrades, spells,spell-like abilities, or carried weapons or equipment), it siphonsoff some of that target’s inherent electricity and regains thenumber of charges listed in the weapon’s usage entry.</p>
Echo	<p>An echo weapon establishes a lingering sonic resonance withina target. A creature with blindsense or blindsight (vibration orsound) can detect a target hit by an echo weapon at a distanceof up to 10 × its normal range. This does not grant blindsenseor blindsight to creatures that do not already have this ability.</p>
Entangle	<p>A creature hit by an entangle weapon becomes entangled until it escapes with an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 + weapon’s item level + the attacker’s Dexterity modifier) or a Strength check (DC = 15 + weapon’s item level + the attacker’s Dexterity modifier). An entangled creature can attempt such a check as a move action. Some weapons (such as stickybomb grenades) have a maximum duration for this effect. See page 275 for information about the entangled condition.</p>
Explode	<p>Explosives have the explode special property, which lists the amount of damage the explosion deals, the damage type, special effects (with a duration, if necessary), and the radius of the explosion. When you attack with this type of weapon or ammunition, aim at a grid intersection. Each creature within the blast radius takes the listed damage but can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. If the explode special property has any special effects other than damage, they are negated with a successful saving throw. Some exploding weapons, such as smoke grenades, don’t deal damage, so they don’t include the damage and damage type entries.</p>
Extinguish	<p>You can expend all remaining charges of this weapon (even ifit has only a single charge or use) as a swift action to removethe burning condition from yourself or an adjacent creature,or to quench the flames in 1 square. If the weapon affects anarea, it extinguishes all flames in that area (including endingthe burning condition for all targets fully within thearea). Extinguishing flames does not prevent thearea from catching fire again, especially if flamessurvive nearby.</p>
Feint	<p>When using this weapon to feint (Core Rulebook 247),you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Bluff check.</p>
Fiery	<p>Fiery ammunition bursts into glowing embers when fired.While this is not enough to change its normal damageto fire damage, any extra damage from a critical hitis considered fire damage and the weapon deals halfdamage to targets that take half damage from energyattacks but no damage from kinetic attacks (such asincorporeal creatures) and counts as a weapon with theexplode special property against creatures with swarmdefenses. If fiery ammunition is used in a weapon thatalready deals half fire damage (such as a weapon with the flamingweapon fusion), on a critical hit, all the damage dealt is fire damage.At the GM’s discretion, fiery ammunition can set extremelyflammable materials on fire, such as oil-soaked rags or dry tinder.</p>
First Arc	<p>A weapon with the first arc special property always generatesan electrical arc, per the critical hit effect (Core Rulebook 182),whenever it hits a target.</p>
Flexible Line	<p>A flexible weapon generates lines of effect at a distance fromthe user. Choose two points, both of which must be within theweapon’s first range increment. The weapon’s effect extends fromone point to the other. Other than this placement, resolve theattack per the line weapon special property (Core Rulebook 181).</p>
Force	<p>A force weapon is treated as having the force descriptor(Core Rulebook 269), which can cause it to interact differentlywith some targets (as defined by the targets’ special rules).Force weapons deal kinetic damage but still target EAC.</p>
Free Hands	<p>A free hands weapon is unbalanced or otherwise awkwardto use. This difficulty in using the weapon can be negatedby moving the listed number of hands that are notholding anything or being used for any other purpose ascounterweights. You wield a free hands weapon using thenormal number of hands, but if you have the listed numberof free hands available while wielding it, the weapon is notconsidered unwieldy. For example, a kasatha wielding a flamespinner in two of her hands while her other two hands remainempty treats the weapon as though it does not have theunwieldy weapon special property.</p>
Fueled	<p>A fueled weapon has an integrated petrol tank and must beactivated to function properly. This works like the poweredweapon special property (Core Rulebook 181), except it usespetrol as a fuel source instead of a battery. Unlike a battery,petrol is permanently expended upon use and must bepurchased rather than recharged.</p>
Grapple	<p>When wielding a grapple weapon, you can use it toperform a grapple combat maneuver without havingyour hands free. When you do so, you gain a +2 bonusto the attack roll, and if you roll a natural 20 on theattack roll, you apply the weapon’s critical hit effect (ifany) to the target.</p>
Gravitation	<p>When you hit a target with a gravitation weapon, you canmove that target the listed distance either toward you oraway from you unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC =10 + 1/2 weapon’s item level + your Dexterity bonus). If thismovement would cause the target to move through a wall,object, or another barrier, the target creature stops moving, butit does not fall prone or take damage. If the movement wouldpush the target off a cliff, into a trap, or otherwise move it intoan area of obvious danger, the target must succeed at a secondReflex saving throw to stop its movement or be moved into thedangerous space. Movement caused by a gravitation weapondoes not trigger attacks of opportunity.</p>
Guided	<p>A guided weapon uses a signal along with wireless telemetry,magnetic guidance, or another means of guiding its payloadafter the weapon has been fired. When you take a moveaction to aim the weapon and then fire it on the same turn(including doing so with a sniper weapon), your target doesnot gain the bonus to AC provided by cover, partial cover, orsoft cover. Improved cover and total cover still confer theirbonuses normally.</p>
Harrying	<p>A harrying weapon produces exceptionally distracting bursts offire. When you take the harrying fire action with this weapon,you gain a +2 insight bonus to your attack roll.</p>
Holy Water	<p>A holy water weapon is infused with the blessings of one ormore good-aligned deities (most commonly Hylax, Iomedae,or Sarenrae within the Pact Worlds, though devoted followersof any good-aligned deity could create such weapons). Itdamages only undead (regardless of alignment) and outsiderswith the evil subtype, and even those creatures suffer noeffect (and show no sign of their nature if it is not alreadyobvious) with a successful saving throw. Crafting a holy watergrenade requires the blessing of formally trained priests of agood deity, though a character of any alignment can do theactual crafting.</p>
Ignite	<p>Weapons with the ignite special property use an accelerantto start small, intense fires on their targets. A target hit by aweapon with this special property must succeed at a Reflexsave (DC = 20 + 1/2 the item’s level + your Dexterity bonus)or gains the burning condition (Core Rulebook 273) with thelisted amount of damage. Gaining the burning conditionmultiple times from the ignite special property does notincrease your burning damage—you take only the highestlisted ignite damage each round. A character who gains theburning condition through other means (such as the burncritical effect, even from a weapon with ignite) does addthat damage to her burning damage each round. Ending theburning condition ends burning from all sources.</p>
Indirect	<p>An indirect weapon uses a wireless signal along with amultistage firing system, internal telemetry, bimetallicfluctuation, magnetic guidance, or some other system to makeit appear as if a shot from the weapon had been fired from adifferent location. This reduces the penalty to Stealth checksfor sniping by 10.</p>
Injection	<p>This weapon or its ammunition can be filled with a drug, an injury poison, or a medicinal compound. On a successful attack with the weapon (either the first attack if it’s a melee weapon or an attack with the relevant piece of ammunition if it’s a ranged weapon), the weapon automatically injects the target with the substance. Refilling the weapon with a new substance acts as reloading it and is a move action. Each different injectable material must be bought separately and can be used in any weapon with the injection special property. See page 231 for rules and prices for drugs, medicinals, and poisons.</p>
Integrated	<p>An integrated weapon can be wielded normally orinstalled in an armor upgrade slot. When properlyinstalled, the weapon is considered to bewielded without needing to assign a number ofhands to wield it. An integrated weapon requiresthe listed number of armor slots for properinstallation. An android or any other creaturewith the upgrade slot racial ability cannotcombine its racial upgrade slot with armorupgrade slots to install an integrated weapon.Installing, removing, or replacing an integratedweapon in a suit of armor takes 10 minutes, as if itwere an armor upgrade.</p>
Line	<p>This weapon fires a projectile in a straight line that pierces through multiple creatures or obstacles. When attacking with such a weapon, make a single attack roll and compare it to the relevant Armor Class of all creatures and objects in a line extending to the weapon’s listed range increment. Roll damage only once. The weapon hits all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll. However, if an attack fails to damage a creature or obstacle hit in the line (typically due to damage reduction or hardness), the path is stopped and the attack doesn’t damage creatures farther away. A line weapon can’t damage targets beyond its listed range. If you score a critical hit, that effect applies only to the first target hit in the line, and you roll the critical damage separately. If multiple creatures are equally close, you choose which one takes the effects of the critical hit. A line weapon doesn’t benefit from feats or abilities that increase the damage of a single attack (such as the operative’s trick attack).</p>
Living	<p>Unlike simpler forms of biotech, a living weapon is not justorganic material—it’s actually a simple living organism. Thecore function of a living weapon is based on the same scientificprinciples as manufactured weapons, but come about as part ofits natural development and body function.<br/>A living weapon can be affected by spells that target creatures,though it is mindless, incapable of independent action, and hasno ability scores other than Constitution (which is always equalto its item level). It is subject to poisons and diseases, thoughit does not need to breath and is always protected as well as acreature with active environmental protection from armor. If itis forced to make a saving throw, its save bonus is always equalto its item level. If it suffers a condition that would normallycause it to take a penalty to attacks, damage, or save DCs, thosepenalties apply to any attack or effect created with it. Livingweapons “eat” by absorbing part of the charges or fuel (orenergy from some other form of ammunition) when fired. Theydo not sleep or breathe, cannot communicate in any way, areimmune to pain effects due to their incredibly simple nervoussystems, and are mindless.<br/>If damaged, a living weapon can regain Hit Points fromeffects that restore Hit Points to living creatures, such as amystic cure spell, and it regains a number of Hit Points equal toits item level each day. You can use the Life Scienceor Medicine skill instead of Engineering to repair aliving weapon.</p>
Lockdown	<p>A construct reduced to 0 Hit Points by a lockdown weapon is not destroyed but simply immobilized until it regains 1 or more Hit Points.</p>
Mind-Affecting	<p>A mind-affecting weapon affects only creatureswith minds; targets that are immune to mindaffectingeffects are immune to this weapon.The damage from mind-affecting weapons is normallyuntyped, in which case it is affected by the samethings that affect damage from the spell mind thrust.For example, if a creature was immune to mind thrust, itwould also be immune to untyped damage from a mindaffectingweapon.</p>
Mine	<p>A weapon with the mine special property is able to modify theammunition fired from it to delay the detonation of its ordnance.Ammunition fired from this weapon (typically a grenadeor mini-rocket) lands at the target grid intersection intact,detonating only when a creature moves into an adjacent square,or automatically detonating after 1d6+1 rounds have passed.</p>
Mire	<p>A mire weapon has a defined area (generally a radius) that ittemporarily turns into difficult terrain. Only a surface can beturned into difficult terrain (you can’t use a mire weapon tocreate difficult terrain in midair, for example), and the difficultterrain affects only the climb speed and land speed of creaturesin the area.</p>
Modal	<p>A modal weapon can be toggled to deal different types ofdamage, with the options listed in the weapon’s damageentry. The weapon can deal only one type of damage at atime; changing the weapon’s mode to deal another damagetype requires a move action. The weapon category of a modalweapon is based on the first damage type listed. If its seconddamage type causes it to be considered a different categoryof weapon when dealing that damage, that category is listedin parentheses. For example, a modal weapon in the flamecategory that deals 1d6 fire damage or 1d6 cold damage lists“modal (cryo)” to indicate that when it is used to deal colddamage, it is treated as a weapon in the cryo category.</p>
Necrotic	<p>A necrotic weapon deals cold damage infused with negative energy. Creatures immune to negative energy (such as the targets of a death ward spell) are immune to the cold damage of a necrotic weapon, and the cold damage of necrotic weapons affects only living creatures. Undead creatures targeted by a weapon with this property not only take no damage from the cold but also gain temporary Hit Points equal to the weapon’s item level. These temporary Hit Points last for 10 minutes, until expended, or until the undead gains a larger number of temporary Hit Points from a necrotic weapon. A creature can benefit from only one source of temporary Hit Points from a necrotic weapon at a time.</p>
Nonlethal	<p>This weapon deals nonlethal damage. See page 252 for more information on how nonlethal damage works.</p>
Operative	<p>An operative can use the trick attack class feature (see page 93) with a weapon that has this special property. Any character can add her Dexterity modifier rather than her Strength modifier on melee attack rolls with weapons with this special property.</p>
Penetrating	<p>A penetrating weapon is designed to punch through large objects’ outer layers, making it easier to damage them. A penetrating weapon ignores an amount of hardness equal to the weapon’s level.</p>
Polarize	<p>A weapon with the polarize special property briefly builds upa polarized charge in a target. When striking a target multipletimes with a weapon with the polarize special property in thesame round, damage from each such strike after the first isincreased by the listed amount. This resets at the beginning ofyour next turn.</p>
Polymorphic	<p>Melee weapons with thepolymorphic weapon special property are madeof a multitude of linked scales that can bereconfigured with a gesture. The wieldercan cause the scales to flatten, form severalcontiguous sharp edges, or stand uprightas a series of points. As a swift action oronce as part of a full action, a creaturewielding a polymorphic weapon can change its damagetype from bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing to another ofthose types.</p>
Powered	<p>A melee weapon with an internal battery that must be charged to function has the powered special property, which lists its capacity and usage. Unlike with a ranged weapon, the usage is for 1 minute of operation rather than per attack, though using a powered weapon for less than 1 full minute still expends 1 full usage. The number of charges expended is equal to the usage × the number of minutes the weapon is used, rounded up to the nearest minute. You can activate the power of the weapon as part of the action used to make an attack with it, and it automatically deactivates after 1 minute.<br/>As with ranged weapons, you can recharge the battery of a powered melee weapon using a generator or a recharging station, or you can purchase new batteries for it. If you try to attack with a powered weapon that’s out of charges, it functions as an improvised weapon (see page 169).</p>
Professional	<p>A professional weapon is a tool used in a specialized trade thatnevertheless has tremendous damaging potential. When usinga professional weapon, you gain a +2 insight bonus to checkswith the listed Profession skill (or to checks with similar skillsthat could reasonably use that weapon as part of the profession,subject to the GM’s discretion). If you have a number of ranksin the listed Profession skill equal to the item level, you areconsidered proficient with that weapon, even if you would notnormally be. This proficiency never counts toward prerequisitesof any kind.</p>
Punch Gun	<p>A punch gun weapon is a small ranged weapon outfitted with apressure-sensitive firing mechanism that is affixed to a glove or asimilar item. Unlike most ranged weapons, which discharge whena trigger is pulled, a punch gun fires when sufficient pressure isplaced upon its barrel. All punch gun projectile weapons have arange equal to their wielder’s natural reach. Although these areranged attacks, they do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
Quick Reload	<p>You can reload this weapon as part of the same action as firing it, instead of taking a move action to reload.</p>
Radioactive	<p>A radioactive weapon contains unstable radioactivecomponents. When the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attackroll, she is exposed to dangerous radiation and must succeedat a Fortitude save or be inflicted with radiation sickness(Core Rulebook 404). (For radioactive blast weapons, theuser must attempt a Fortitude save if any of the attacks are anatural 1). This is considered a low level of radiation. The DCsfor this save and the disease are each equal to the weapon’scritical hit DC.</p>
Reach	<p>Only melee weapons can have the reach special property. Wielding a weapon with reach gives you 10 feet of reach for attacks with that weapon. See Reach and Threatened Squares on page 255 for more information.</p>
Recall	<p>A recall weapon is keyed to a wristband or another smalldevice worn by the wearer (which does not count against themaximum of two worn magic or hybrid items). If you throw arecall weapon and your attack misses, the weapon returns toyou at the end of your turn.</p>
Reposition	<p>When you attempt a reposition combat maneuverwith this weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll.</p>
Shape	<p>A weapon with the shape special property has a complextargeting array that allows it to target specified areas. If youmake a single attack as a full action with such a weapon, youcan exclude the listed number of squares from within thisweapon’s area of effect. This means you can avoid shooting anally in the area of a blast weapon’s effect, for example.</p>
Shells	<p>A few melee weapons can be loaded with scattergun shellsto create a powerful close-range, one-shot attack. A weaponwith the shell special property lists its capacity and usagevalue. Unlike charges for powered melee weapons, thisusage is per attack.</p>
Shield	<p>A shield weapon encapsulates the target in a short-term forcefield. This force field lasts until the start of your next turn oruntil it has absorbed the listed amount of damage, whicheveroccurs first. A force field originating from a shield weaponblocks only incoming damage; it does not interfere in any waywith the target’s weapons or attacks. You can’t use a shieldprojector to target yourself.</p>
Sniper	<p>Weapons with the sniper special property can be fired accurately at very long ranges if aimed properly. If you aim the weapon as a move action and then fire it on the same turn, use the value listed with the sniper special property as the weapon’s range increment. You can still fire a sniper weapon as normal, but it has only the range listed under its normal range entry when you do.</p>
Stun	<p>You can set a weapon with the stun special property to stun mode (or reset it to normal mode) as a move action. While in stun mode, all the weapon’s attacks are nonlethal. See page 252 for more about how nonlethal damage works.</p>
Subtle	<p>A subtle weapon fires either very small ordnance or otherwisegenerates a nearly imperceptible discharge that even thetarget may not be aware of. A target hit by a subtle weaponmust succeed at a Perception check with a DC equal to 15+ 1-1/2 the weapon’s item level or it doesn’t realize it hasbeen struck. The target notices other effects conveyed by asubtle weapon, such as an injected substance, as normal. Forexample, you might use a subtle weapon to inject a target witha poison with an onset delay; the target may not realize it hasbeen hit by the dart, but it would notice the effects of thepoison once it took effect.</p>
Sunder	<p>When you attempt a sunder combat maneuver while wielding aweapon with the sunder weapon special property, you gain a +2bonus to your attack roll.</p>
Swarm	<p>A weapon with this special property is virtually indistinguishable from Swarm technology and requires a special Swarm battery to use efficiently. The weapon can use other batteries, but usage doubles when doing so.<br/>In addition to the energy drawback, a Swarm weapon attracts the attention of nearby Swarm creatures. They can sense such a weapon as if using blindsense with a range of 30 feet. Swarm components have been observed fixating on wielders of this technology during battle, with little else to explain such a violent focus. If the Swarm wins the conflict, the surviving components destroy these weapons.</p>
Tail	<p>If you have a tail (or similar taillike appendage), you can weara weapon with the tail weapon special property on your tail,rather than wield it in your hand. Attaching or removing a tailweapon is a full action, and once it’s installed, you wield theweapon without using your hands.</p>
Teleportive	<p>This weapon’s fired ammunition teleports a shortdistance after being fired. You take only a –1 cumulative penaltywhen attacking outside the range of this weapon.</p>
Thought	<p>A thought weapon can be fully or partially controlled viatelepathy. If you have the telepathy or limited telepathyracial trait, are benefiting from a telepathy spell, are wearinga mindlink circlet, or have a similar ability, you ignore theweapon’s unwieldy weapon special property.</p>
Throttle	<p>A throttle weapon deals damage only when it is used tograpple a foe, automatically dealing damage with everysuccessful grapple combat maneuver. These are consideredattacks for abilities that can increase a weapon’s damage(such as trick attack). All throttle weapons are also grappleweapons. While a target is successfully being grappled witha throttle weapon, it cannot use its airways to speak or makevocalizations of any kind (though other forms of makingnoise work normally).</p>
Thrown	<p>Ranged weapons that must be thrown and melee weapons that can be thrown as a ranged attack have the thrown special property. You apply your Strength modifier to damage rolls for thrown attacks. After you throw a weapon, it lands near your target and you must recover it if you want to attack with it again.</p>
Trip	<p>When you attempt a trip combat maneuver while wielding a weapon with this property, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll.</p>
Underwater	<p>A weapon with this special property that is used underwater ignores the –2 penalty to attack rolls and deals full damage.</p>
Unwieldy	<p>Weapons with the unwieldy special property are large and awkward, can’t be fired without cooling down first, or are otherwise difficult to use with repeated attacks. You can’t use an unwieldy weapon as part of a full attack (or any other action in which you could make multiple attacks), you can’t attack with it more than once per round, and you can’t use it to make an attack of opportunity.</p>
Variant Boost	<p>A weapon with the variant boost special property acts as aweapon with the boost special property (Core Rulebook 181),except boosting the weapon does not expend additional chargesand the weapon can be boosted only the listed number of timesper day.</p>
Wide Line	<p>A wide line weapon functions as a weapon with the lineweapon special property (Core Rulebook 181), except the lineis 10 feet wide. When determining the squares that are in thepath of a line, note which squares that line would normallypass through (Core Rulebook 268), and extend the area to oneside of the line (your choice) so that the line is 2 squares wide.For an obstacle to block the path of a line, it must block theline’s full width; otherwise, the line continues (at full width)beyond the obstacle.</p>
