Unarmed strikes deal nonlethal damage, and the damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus to weapon damage rolls.</p>	1	0	0	1d3 B	1	3	B	null	null	null	null	0	Archaic, nonlethal	CRB	190
2	Club	<p>A club is any sort of blunt, oblong instrument with a haft suitable for gripping. Clubs can be made of stone, wood, or similar materials. Metal clubs exist as well, and they are usually hollow to keep them from being too heavy. Some Free Captains refer to clubs as belaying pins, though those archaic items are not required on starships.</p>	1	0	0	1d6 B	1	6	B	null	null	null	null	L	Analog, archaic	CRB	187
3	Baton, Tactical	<p>A baton is a thin, solid metal shaft, usually with a textured rubber grip. A tactical baton can be used to inflict precise bludgeoning blows. An advanced baton, used by elite mercenary and security companies, often has an additional shaft, as well as a weighted end that can be powered to connect with substantially more force than a tactical baton.</p>	1	1	90	1d4 B	1	4	B	null	null	null	null	L	Analog, operative	CRB	184
4	Battleglove, Cestus	<p>Battlegloves are popular, economical choices for mercenaries and guards. These durable nylon-web or para-aramid gloves hold a weighted plate over the wearer’s knuckles.

5	Handaxe, Basic	<p>A balanced, wedge-shaped blade affixed to a lightweight haft,  a handaxe can be wielded in melee or thrown. The flexibility of  handaxes makes them a favorite of explorers of all types, and the  basic handaxe is a common tool that can be used as a weapon.  A tactical handaxe is made of a stronger, lightweight alloy, while  the sintered handaxe uses a denser ceramic material for added  heft and a much keener edge. An ultrathin handaxe has a blade so  thin it can’t be seen clearly, while the molecular rift handaxe has a  blade narrow enough to slice between molecules. Most handaxes  have blade covers to prevent accidental injury to the wielder.</p>	1	1	90	1d4 S	1	4	S	null	null	null	null	L	Analog, thrown (20 ft.)	ARM	52
6	Knife, Survival	<p>These light blades can be used for both mundane tasks and combat. A typical survival knife has a fixed, single-edged, carbon-steel or ceramic blade and is treated against corrosion. Tactical knives have large, double-edged blades, often with a section of serrated blade near the haft, and they come in both fixed- and folding-blade designs; users may prefer one style or the other, but the two are identical in terms of price, weight, and damage dealt.</p>	1	1	95	1d4 S	1	4	S	null	null	null	null	L	Analog, operative	CRB	185
7	Sword Cane, Tactical	<p>This thin blade comes with a scabbard that makes it resemble a stylish cane. Sword canes are popular on Absalom Station, where similar nonweapon items have some popularity as fashionable affectations. A sword cane can incorporate one of the following at the standard price for that item: 20 feet of retractable cable line, a personal comm unit, or a spotlight. A successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the weapon’s item level) is required to identify a sword cane as a weapon when it is sheathed.</p>	1	1	250	1d4 P	1	4	P	null	Bleed 1d3	null	null	L	Analog, operative	PWD	194

9	Bone Cestus, Austere	<p>Centuries ago, some kasathas crafted simple weapons out of crest-eaters’ bony protrusions; these formidable gauntlets were badges of honor for the mightiest kasathan warriors, and modern artisans have recreated that aesthetic in the form of bone cestuses, though now they are usually formed of state-of-the-art resin instead of crest-eater bone. Due to the flecks of minerals embedded within, bone cestuses are often warm to the touch, especially after they have been exposed to natural sunlight.

10	Dueling Sword, Tactical	<p>While dueling swords are crafted to be aesthetically pleasing and are often seen as a mark of rank or tradition, many warriors still train with them to deadly effect. The powered blades of both buzzblade and ripper dueling swords bring this danger into the modern era, while the molecular rift sword—though unpowered—uses a field of disrupted molecules along its blade to slice through nearly anything, and must be stored in a magnetic sheath that never actually touches the blade.</p>	1	2	475	1d6 S	1	6	S	null	null	null	null	L	Analog	CRB	187
11	Idaran Force Training Baton	<p>This looks like a normal tactical baton, except it is much  thinner and lighter. The baton has passive nanoengineering  such that swinging it hard enough through any atmosphere  creates an electromagnetic force.<br/>  The damage from this weapon counts as a force effect when  wielded by a character with at least 12 Strength. Note, this  does not mean the weapon deals force damage, only that  it counts as a force effect for overcoming certain defenses  such as incorporeal.</p>	1	2	400	1d4 B	1	4	B	null	null	null	null	L	Operative, powered (capacity 20, usage 1)	SFS1	12
12	Sap, Light	<p>A weapon dating back to antiquity, a sap is shaped like a large,  flat spoon with a heavily weighted end. Archaeological digs have  verified that almost every society develops an analog to the sap.  Modern versions are constructed from high-tech fiber and dense  alloys. Although sap models are referred to as light, medium, and  heavy by users, it’s the rare materials used in various models, and  not their actual weight, that make them progressively better at  bludgeoning victims into unconsciousness.</p>	1	2	450	1d4 B	1	4	B	null	null	null	null	L	Analog, nonlethal, operative	ARM	53
13	Sledge	<p>Similar to the assault hammer (Core Rulebook 189), the sledge  has an exceptionally dense weighted head and a strong haft.

14	Switchblade, Tactical	<p>This blade looks much like a single-edged survival knife when  opened, but the blade can be folded or collapsed to fit within the  grip, making it easier to conceal. A switch on the knife means  the blade can be folded or extended as a swift action, or as part  of making an attack or full attack. Most weapon manufacturers  that offer daggers also produce switchblades, which are made in  the same models: tactical, ultrathin, zero-edge, and molecular rift.</p>	1	3	1300	1d4 S	1	4	S	null	null	null	null	L	Analog, conceal, operative	ARM	54

The reanimated ranks of the converted earn their swords through tallied kill counts, while officers receive their blades as part of the transition to the rank of commander. The blades of Corpse Fleet admirals are some of the keenest weapons in the known galaxy, despite being mostly employed as holdout weapons.</p>	1	4	2100	1d8 S	1	8	S	null	null	null	null	L	Analog	DS03	48

17	Inferno Knife	<p>Not all developments in military technology are  successful. Originally designed to be a perfect survival  tool, the inferno knife combines the cutting prowess of  a survival knife with the virtues of a lighter and road  flare. By squeezing one trigger, the user can inject a small  stream of fuel from the hilt’s reservoir onto the blade’s  tip, and a secondary trigger can ignite it, creating a small  torch to signal others or light campfires. The product’s  launch was disastrous, and users logged hundreds of  complaints about the knives’ needless complexity. As  a result, inferno knives have flooded the market and  become showy weapons for criminals and performers,  though timing the blade’s ignition in combat remains an  unpredictable art.<br/>  An inferno knife is a 4th-level basic melee weapon with  the analog and operative special properties. It deals 1d4  slashing damage and has the burn 1d6 critical hit effect.  It costs 2,100 credits and has light bulk. An inferno knife  uses petrol as fuel. It contains enough fuel to remain lit for  1 hour, shedding light in a 20-foot radius. Each successful  critical hit reduces the remaining duration by 5 minutes. A  single charge of petrol refills the weapon’s reservoir.</p>	1	4	2100	1d4 S	1	4	S	null	Burn 1d6	null	null	L	Analog, operative	DS02	12

You can extend the spike as a  move action and retract the spike as a swift action. Such a spike  usually extends from the elbow, foot, knee, or wrist, but a spike  can be fitted into a helmet or an android’s head for use in headbutting  or goring foes. Retractable spikes are widely available  throughout the Pact Worlds, with the various models—tactical,  advanced, elite, and paragon—having individual rarity based on  the credit outlay to acquire a given model.</p>	1	5	3150	1d4 P	1	4	P	null	null	null	null	L	Conceal, integrated (1 slot), operative	ARM	53
22	Spined Blade, Basic	<p>Kasathas on their home world wielded spined blades to better  poison foes.

Modern  warriors use refined versions of the weapon that are effective at  delivering poisons and similar substances through contemporary  armor. You apply such substances to the blade per rules found  on page 232 of the Core Rulebook.

Zero-edge daggers have blades—crafted with quantum technology—that are so fine, their edges blur. The blade of a molecular rift dagger looks translucent, as if it’s made of glass, and its vibrating particles allow the dagger to slice through almost any substance.

The flexibility of  handaxes makes them a favorite of explorers of all types, and the  basic handaxe is a common tool that can be used as a weapon.  A tactical handaxe is made of a stronger, lightweight alloy, while  the sintered handaxe uses a denser ceramic material for added  heft and a much keener edge. An ultrathin handaxe has a blade so  thin it can’t be seen clearly, while the molecular rift handaxe has a  blade narrow enough to slice between molecules.

A tank found at the butt of the spear allows substances  to be poured into the weapon, and a spring-loaded mechanism  automatically injects foes upon striking a  successful blow. The exact origins of this  dastardly weapon are unknown, though  both the grays and a notorious race of  subterranean creatures from Golarion are  claimed to have designed this weapon for  torturous experimentation.</p>	2	11	25000	3d10 P	3	10	P	null	Injection DC +2	null	null	L	Injection	COM	124

That’s no accident, as the weapon’s primary use  is to silently strangle creatures. However, a garrote can also be  used to ensnare appendages. The wire garrote is the simplest  version, while the nanofiber, microfilament, and monowire  models use increasingly fine cables to deal substantially more  damage. For instance, the monowire version has a cable as thin  as a single complex molecule, which closes into the handles  when the weapon isn’t in use. This construction results in a  nearly invisible cable with an extreme edge.</p>	2	12	34800	4d4 S	4	4	S	null	Bleed 1d6	null	null	L	Analog, conceal, grapple, operative, throttle	ARM	52

103	Lance, Elite	<p>A lance is a long, heavy spear designed for use while riding a  mount. While mounted or riding a cycle, you can wield a lance  with one hand. This weapon is common across the Pact Worlds.  Traditionally used by shotalashu warriors riding saurian mounts  in the jungles of Castrovel and bonded ryphorian and dragonkin  partners of Triaxus, lances are also known to have been common  weapons on lost Golarion. Modern wielders use lances while  mounted or driving open vehicles, such as cycle-riding raiders  like the Vercite Rustrunners. Tactical lances are straightforward  and widely available, while advanced lances are made of strong  composites and have fine points to deal more damage. Elite lances  have superfine points, and each has a particularly dense core  for a more powerful strike. Paragon lances have been entirely  redesigned using dense, flexible materials and an ultrathin point  to achieve incomparable performance.</p>	2	13	50800	5d6 P	5	6	P	null	null	null	null	1	Analog, reach	ARM	52
104	Greataxe, Molecular Rift	<p>No one can argue against the damage potential of a greataxe.  Half-orcs who take an interest in fragmentary records from  lost Golarion embrace the greataxe as a cultural symbol.  Tactical greataxes are the most common, but sintered models  are made of dense ceramic and designed to increase the axe’s  effectiveness against modern gear. It’s hard to tell ultrathin  greataxes from molecular rift models at a glance, but one’s edge  is merely blurry while the other’s is actually translucent.</p>	2	14	69800	4d12 S	4	12	S	null	null	null	null	1	Analog	ARM	52

Few are foolish enough to  use such a weapon, so there’s been little advancement on its  design, but many space goblins use junk censers with reckless  and even gleeful abandon. While it is most often wielded in  melee, the junk censer can also be thrown at an enemy. Like  many cobbled-together weapons, a junk censer is unstable; on  an attack roll of a natural 1, it deals its regular damage to the  user and gains the broken condition.</p>	5	1	125	1d6 B & F	1	6	B & F	null	Burn 1d4	null	null	L	Analog, fueled (capacity 20, usage 4), thrown (10 ft.)

A flat cartridge containing an injectable substance (such as a medicinal or poison) is inserted into a slot in the pointer finger of the glove, where it connects with a retractable needle. When the pointer finger encounters resistance, the needle pops out and injects its contents.

Rather than trigger the injection on the weapon’s first attack, you can choose whether to inject one of these substances upon dealing damage with the painclaw (and even select which material to inject, if the three reservoirs contain different compounds). A painclaw can inject only one substance per attack.<br/>  The hand wearing a painclaw can’t be used to hold or operate any other weapon or piece of equipment. Donning or removing the painclaw is a full action. A painclaw cannot be disarmed.</p>	9	3	1250	1d8 S & P	1	8	S & P	null	null	null	null	1	Injection (see text), unwieldy, usage (1, 40 charges)	DS02	53

Shirrens favor  talons, and some consider them to be holy weapons of Hylax,  referring to them as the queen’s talons.

247	Hardlight Hand Wrap, Diffuse	<p>A hardlight hand wrap consists of a small generator of force  energy built into a form-fitting glove made of interwoven  photoelectric ribbon. The weapon uses cutting-edge hologram  technology to create bursts of hardlight that can briefly  interact with both corporeal and incorporeal beings. It takes  a bit of training to perfect the timing of strikes made with a  hardlight hand wrap, as you must activate the force generator  at the precise moment you hit your target, but many feel that  the practice is worth the effort. Relatively inconspicuous and  easily modifiable to fit any species’ anatomy, hardlight hand  wraps are invaluable when facing living holograms, ghosts,  and other incorporeal dangers.<br/>  Hardlight hand wraps can be customized to shine in  any color in the visible spectrum when used, and a few  manufacturers of weapon accessories even offer custom  firmware that modifies the appearance of a hardlight hand  wrap to manifest as an animalistic claw or fist when used.  This doesn’t change the weapon’s statistics, but it can be  intimidating on the field of battle. A few unscrupulous types  wield hardlight hand wraps when attempting to impersonate  solarians, usually to scare off their enemies or as part of  complicated con jobs.

Rather than trigger the injection on the weapon’s first attack, you can choose whether to inject one of these substances upon dealing damage with the painclaw (and even select which material to inject, if the three reservoirs contain different compounds). A painclaw can inject only one substance per attack.<br/>  The hand wearing a painclaw can’t be used to hold or operate any other weapon or piece of equipment.

298	Hardlight Hand Wrap, Incandescent	<p>A hardlight hand wrap consists of a small generator of force  energy built into a form-fitting glove made of interwoven  photoelectric ribbon. The weapon uses cutting-edge hologram  technology to create bursts of hardlight that can briefly  interact with both corporeal and incorporeal beings. It takes  a bit of training to perfect the timing of strikes made with a  hardlight hand wrap, as you must activate the force generator  at the precise moment you hit your target, but many feel that  the practice is worth the effort. Relatively inconspicuous and  easily modifiable to fit any species’ anatomy, hardlight hand  wraps are invaluable when facing living holograms, ghosts,  and other incorporeal dangers.<br/>  Hardlight hand wraps can be customized to shine in  any color in the visible spectrum when used, and a few  manufacturers of weapon accessories even offer custom  firmware that modifies the appearance of a hardlight hand  wrap to manifest as an animalistic claw or fist when used.  This doesn’t change the weapon’s statistics, but it can be  intimidating on the field of battle. A few unscrupulous types  wield hardlight hand wraps when attempting to impersonate  solarians, usually to scare off their enemies or as part of  complicated con jobs. However, these ruses quickly fall apart  when the faux solarians are unable to manifest any other  powers these mystic warriors possess.</p>	9	20	880000	11d8 B	11	8	B	null	null	null	null	L	Bright, force, powered (capacity 40, usage 2)	AA3	67

When powered, the talon converts  energy into acid that can melt through certain types of armor  (though the weapon always targets a foe’s KAC). Shirrens favor  talons, and some consider them to be holy weapons of Hylax,  referring to them as the queen’s talons. Increasingly advanced  models of the weapon are often named after roles of some hivedwelling  species, beginning with drone, and advancing through  warrior, knight, queen, and god.</p>	9	20	925000	8d12 A or S	8	12	A or S	null	Corrode 4d6	null	null	L	Modal, powered (capacity 40, usage 2)	ARM	54

Battle ribbons are  difficult to use without training, so most who take up the battle  ribbon seek apprenticeship with the famous battleflowers of  Ning to learn the elaborate performance art—though acquiring  such a mentor is difficult, as they take students only rarely.  Battle ribbon varieties start with modern materials used in a  traditional blade, then proceed to the innovations of the microedge  and zero-edge battle ribbons.</p>	15	3	270	1d8 S	1	8	S	null	null	null	null	1	Analog, operative, professional (dancer)	ARM	52

Ideal for devastating overhand blows and catching and parrying enemy weapons, its use is a highly respected art form in traditional vesk society, but it also sees use by creatures of other races as a variant axe. Traditionally, doshkos are made of steel, but in recent decades they have been crafted using advanced metallurgic techniques and even quantum technology to improve the stabbing edges.<br/>  Ultrathin doshko blades look exceptionally delicate but hold a fine edge. Zero-edge doshkos appear to have a blurred edge, while molecular rift doshkos have translucent blades. Dimensional blade doshkos have a narrower visible blade, but the solid surrounding aura makes them vicious weapons.</p>	15	19	546100	13d12 P	13	12	P	null	null	null	null	1	Analog, unwieldy	CRB	187

Using a complex array of  internal energy conductors powered by Pact Worlds high‑,  super-, and ultra-capacity batteries, the technological  components of phasic scythes can replicate the nyssholora’s  nervous system by causing an authentic nyssholora claw to  vibrate at similar frequencies to their natural counterparts.  These weapons slice through solid matter with wicked  efficiency, sometimes leaving their living targets with  lasting wounds.

Designed to  lock around a creature’s neck, each of a  capture pole’s prongs are outfitted with  armor-piercing syringes used to inject a  creature with a substance, typically a sedative to make  apprehension easier. This occurs on a successful attack roll for  a melee attack or grapple combat maneuver. Capture poles are  favored weapons among the drow, who use them to capture  slaves and discipline their orc servants.</p>	15	20	855000	15d8 P	15	8	P	null	Injection DC +2	null	null	L	Grapple, injection, reach	COM	124

The blade of an ultrathin curve blade looks delicate, but it is as hard as carbon steel and keeps a fine edge. Buzzblade curve blades vibrate when powered, tearing organic flesh and causing additional bleed damage. Dimensional slice curve blades have only a narrow visible blade area, surrounded by a solid aura; these are the sharpest and most dangerous curve blades on the market.</p>	15	20	815000	12d10 S	12	10	S	null	Bleed 6d6	null	null	2	Powered (capacity 40, usage 2)	CRB	187

578	Laser Pistol, Zenith	<p>The laser pistol is possibly the most common small arm used by explorers, guards, mercenaries, and traders. Laser pistols are light and reliable, yet they still deal a respectable amount of damage. </p>	20	17	245200	8d4 F	8	4	F	100	Burn 4d4	80 charges	4	L	null	CRB	184
579	Shoulder Laser, Perihelion	<p>This laser weapon has a smooth, curved housing and an eyelike  aperture, and it can be installed in an armor upgrade slot, leaving  the wielder’s hands free for other tasks. As the name implies,  most users mount the eyelike aperture over one shoulder, but  it can work just as easily mounted on the torso or a forearm.  Many shoulder laser users are androids who integrate them into  their bodies as emergency weapons. Azimuth, corona, aphelion,  and perihelion shoulder lasers are available in most areas. </p>	20	18	383000	3d8 F	3	8	F	40	Burn 3d6	20 charges	1	L	Integrated (1 slot)	ARM	41
580	Compliance Ray, Sunspot	<p>With a wider beam than typical  lasers, the compliance ray is  designed for crowd control and  other nonmilitary uses. Although  these rays are legal for civilians to own,  most models are themed to fit in with the local constabulary’s  armor; the Stewards’ blue-and-gold models are common  throughout the Pact Worlds. Shots from these pistols cause  intense discomfort, and a hit to the eyes can cause temporary  blindness. Models begin with the flash designation and increase  in intensity as follows: flare, strobe, starburst, and sunspot. </p>	20	19	545000	9d4 F	9	4	F	80	Blind	20 charges	1	L	Nonlethal	ARM	40

The weapon is more effective than but just as light as typical laser small arms, and even more so with a slotted aeon stone. A trilaser is also a prestige item, since carrying one openly is a privilege Aeon Guards can enjoy even in civilian garb.</p>	20	20	739250	8d6 F	8	6	F	100	Burn 4d4	80 charges	4	L	Aeon	AT02	45

Medic and zoologist injector pistols are  often used by xenobiologists studying unintelligent species;  poacher, subjugation, and elite injector pistols are generally  regarded as illicit since they more often used to target  sentient species, though most markets nevertheless carry  the weapons. </p>	22	14	68500	5d6 P	5	6	P	80	Injection DC +2	20 darts	1	L	Injection	ARM	44
630	Gyrojet Pistol, Tactical	<p>Gyrojet pistols fire mini-rockets that can hit with a force great enough to knock down targets.

632	Cestus Pistol, Paragon	<p>This weapon consists of a black leather glove that is mounted  with a small, single-round firearm. Unlike most firearms, the  weapon is designed to fire when pressure is placed upon its  barrel rather than using a hand-based triggering mechanism. As  a result, wielders must press a cestus pistol up against whatever  they intend to shoot in order to discharge the weapon’s round,  giving the weapon limited range.</p>	22	16	162000	6d12 P	6	12	P	Reach	Bleed 1d8	1 round	1	0	Conceal, punch gun	COM	124
633	Rotating Pistol, Elite	<p>A rotating pistol is a modern execution of an ancient design  found on Golarion and several other worlds. The multiple  barrels on this pistol rotate while firing to dissipate heat, which  allows a more powerful shot without melting the weapon. The  rotating pistol’s shots deal significant damage to their target,  but the weapon requires frequent reloading. Rotating pistols are  available in tactical, advanced, and elite models.</p>	22	16	153000	8d4 P	8	4	P	40	null	8 rounds	1	L	Analog, conceal	ARM	44

635	Skipshot Pistol, Paragon	<p>The maggedli of the Helfen-Thel system manufacture these  firearms and imbue them with their magical expertise. Although  the pistols use a clip of ordinary rounds, the  pistol imbues teleportation magic into the  ammunition as it’s fired. A skipshot pistol is a  hybrid item.</p>	22	17	216500	11d4 P	11	4	P	60	Bleed 5d6	20 rounds	1	L	Teleportive	NSP	150
636	Handcannon, Gasconade	<p>Handcannons are popular with those who want to impress  or intimidate their foes through the sheer presence of their  armament without having to invest in the training required to  master longarms or heavy weaponry. Its oversized barrel and  muzzle are somewhat precariously balanced on a one-handed  grip, though most wielders use both hands to make the weapon  more manageable in combat situations. The various model  names of this weapon—bravado, swagger, bombast, braggadocio,  and gasconade—were originally facetious references to the  character of those who tend to favor them, though many users  embrace the names unironically.</p>	22	18	364000	8d8 P	8	8	P	40	Knockdown	12 shells	1	1	Analog, free hands (1), unwieldy	ARM	44

643	Anchor Pistol, Voltaic	<p>Blasts from this electromagnetic pistol create a magnetic field  that hampers a foe’s movement. Barathus working on Liavara  developed these weapons, as the magnetic fields ensnare  a target without causing it to fall—a useful feature when  confronting the operators of illicit harvesting endeavors on  a gas giant. Many parts of an anchor pistol are grown from  living organisms, resulting in a lightweight pistol that gleams  like mother-of-pearl. Voltaic anchor pistols employ typical  electromagnetism, while the emergent and inductive anchor  pistols use higher symmetries to produce aperiodic force.

In the Pact Worlds, the most common  models reflect the slim profile of Vercite technology or the bony  protrusions of Eoxian design. Hiemal, algid, and glacial freeze  rays simply produce an extreme reduction in the temperature  along the weapon’s line of effect. Isothermal freeze rays  cause a persistent temperature drop, dealing further damage,  while hypothermic freeze rays causes multiple temperature  reductions in rapid succession for further increased destruction.</p>	26	3	1420	1d4 C	1	4	C	30	Staggered	20 charges	4	2	Line, unwieldy	ARM	34

Grave- and crypt-class void rifles are  an option for standard issue among rank-and-file marines of the  Eoxian navy, while tomb-, ossuary-, and barrow-class void rifles  are reserved for elite forces.</p>	26	19	606000	6d10 C	6	10	C	100	Suffocate	80 charges	2	1	Antibiological, boost 2d10	ARM	36
732	Freeze Ray, Hypothermic	<p>Across the galaxy, practically every sufficiently advanced  civilization has created its own variation of the freeze ray. All  freeze rays function in a similar way, emitting a long line of  supercooled gas, but individual models reflect their species’  design aesthetics. In the Pact Worlds, the most common  models reflect the slim profile of Vercite technology or the bony  protrusions of Eoxian design. Hiemal, algid, and glacial freeze  rays simply produce an extreme reduction in the temperature  along the weapon’s line of effect. Isothermal freeze rays  cause a persistent temperature drop, dealing further damage,  while hypothermic freeze rays causes multiple temperature  reductions in rapid succession for further increased destruction.</p>	26	20	818000	5d12 C	5	12	C	50	Staggered	20 charges	4	2	Line, unwieldy	ARM	34
733	Disruption Rifle, Minor	<p>A dimensional disruption weapon creates a stream-like gravitational wave function that disrupts subatomic fields in an effect similar to a sonic attack, but it can stagger a target rather than deafen it, as the wave function momentarily disrupts the fabric of space around the target.<br/>  Disruption pistols and rifles expend twice the usage and have half the range when used on any plane other than the Material Plane.

These weapons were first introduced to the Pact Worlds by  skittermanders (Starfinder Alien Archive 106), though their  current nomenclature (tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon)  was imposed by other weapons manufacturers. </p>	30	10	17100	2d6 F	2	6	F	80	null	20 charges	1	1	Boost 2d6	ARM	40

Most  technologically advanced civilizations develop excavation lasers,  and the tools are commonly seen in the hands of workers from  the Ulrikka Clanholdings and other miners in the Diaspora.

784	Serpent Laser, Perihelion	<p>The serpent laser is a creation of the Aspis Consortium, meant to  undercut the pricing of its competitors while consuming battery  charges at a higher rate to drive the sale of additional batteries,  higher-capacity batteries, and recharging services. Experienced  spacefarers know the scheme behind the serpent laser and  generally avoid what they have come to call the “snakebite laser,”  though amateurs and novices often fall for the low initial price.  Serpent lasers have the same model names as many standard  laser rifles (azimuth, corona, aphelion, and perihelion), though  savvy customers know that the serpent laser models are often  slightly less powerful than their conventional counterparts. </p>	30	14	66000	3d12 F	3	12	F	120	Burn 4d4	40 charges	20	1	null	ARM	41

837	RPPR, AG	<p>The AG series of longarms is manufactured by government-held factories for the sole use of the Aeon Guard. Its ingenious designers are held via lifelong “contracts” as pampered but neurally locked prisoners of the throne. The AG assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that is standard issue for rank-and-file troops. Other weapons in the series include the AG accelerator rifle, which uses magnetic fields to propel metal projectiles like a magnetar rifle does, and the rocket propelled–projectile rifle (RPPR, or “Ripper,” as it’s known in the ranks of the Aeon Guard), which fires mini-rockets like those used in gyrojet rifles. Pact Worlds intelligence believes that some AG weapons can also be equipped with aeon stones, though what functions they provide and how this hybrid technology actually works is unknown. In the Azlanti Star Empire, civilian possession of any AG-series weapon is a criminal offense punishable by death.</p>	32	10	21000	2d12 B	2	12	B	100	Knockdown	12 mini-rockets	1	2	null	AA1	7

These weapons are most commonly seen in the hands of  space pirates who need to blast through plastic interior doors,  though expert users can use these weapons to break through  airlock doors. Breaching guns also saw widespread use on  Absalom Station in the aftermath of the Gap, as security forces  desperately tried to maintain control over the station’s fractured  and panicked population, which often required blasting through  barricades and sealed interior airlocks.

1046	Dart Cannon, Paragon	<p>When Akiton’s economy began to collapse in the wake of   the thasteron bust, scrappy frontier townspeople were left  to cobble together their necessities from whatever they had  on hand and defend what resources they had from outside  raiders. Dart cannons were created by these inventive souls,  who reconfigured their depreciated mining equipment and  less critical medical supplies into a weapon to stave off looters  and thieves. These wide-barreled cannons fire a barrage of  magnetically accelerated darts that contain barbed cores rather  than toxins or medicinals. While this prevents the darts from  being used to inject substances, the barbs can lodge in a target’s  body, dealing lasting damage. Dart cannons tend to see use in  environments with some level of gravity, as no one wants to  deal with the aftermath of a dart cannon’s discharge in a zero-g  environment. This weapon is available in light, tactical, heavy,  advanced, elite, and paragon models.</p>	41	19	584000	9d12 P	9	12	P	1500	Embed 3d12	50 darts	5	2	Unwieldy	ARM	43
1047	Desperation Cannon, Titan-Killer	<p>Few damai are brave enough to confront the titanic colossi that  roam the devastated world of Daimalko, but some have no choice.  This plasma weapon not only delivers a powerful blast capable  of penetrating a colossus’s thick hide, but it delivers a blast of  light and noise drawing the target’s attention from others. Some  desperation cannons are used in only one battle, unless they’re  later recovered from wreckage by scavengers.</p>	41	19	565000	9d12 E & F	9	12	E & F	100	Nuisance	100 charges	20	2	Bright, penetrating, unwieldy	NSP	149
1048	Rail Cannon, Paragon	<p>Rail cannons are scaled-up versions of rail guns, and like rail  guns, they use magnetic fields to rapidly accelerate ammunition.  A rail cannon generates such phenomenal force that its rounds  can pass entirely through multiple targets, allowing the user to  hit multiple targets in a line. Tactical rail cannons are precise  and effective, while advanced rail cannons offer more firepower;  elite and paragon rail cannons are generally used only by heavyweapons  specialists in professional military groups.</p>	41	19	591000	12d10 P	12	10	P	100	Bleed 4d6	60 rounds	10	2	Line, unwieldy	ARM	44

While many shock weapons have a chance to arc to  a second target on a hit, the arc caster is designed to achieve  that feat on every shot, and particularly well-aimed strikes can  sometimes arc twice. The storm and tempest models feature  improvements that build upon the capabilities of static and  aurora arc casters. Since there is little way to control which  creatures are struck on the subsequent arcs, arc casters are  generally used only by solo combatants or those with little regard  for their allies’ well-being. More rarely, party members may take  particular precautions against electricity damage, such as with a  resistant armor spell or an electrostatic field armor upgrade, to  protect themselves from an ally wielding an arc caster.</p>	42	1	375	1d8 E	1	8	E	60	Second arc 1d6	20 charges	2	2	First arc 1d6, unwieldy	ARM	45

Like most  barathu creations, stormcallers are living creatures, and their  massive shells are large enough to require two hands to wield,  aided by the stormcaller wrapping its translucent tentacles  around the user’s appendages.

This heavy firearm has  a barrel sporting a series of toroidal high-voltage generators  that collectively produce powerful arcs of electricity, and it  can be overcharged to deliver even more destructive blasts.  The electric blast sometimes overwhelms its target, branching  off to hit another. The corona colossus coil produces a ring of  electricity, while a brush colossus coil produces a more diffuse  field.

1089	Resonator, Linear	<p>A resonator is a boxy device with a terminal along the top and  a series of concentric rings of metal and crystal in front to  focus the weapon’s harmonics. A shoulder strap helps offset  the weapon’s considerable weight, allowing the use of a top  handle to direct output while freeing up the other hand to  operate the controls. A resonator generates sonic waves at  frequencies set to resound within the targeted material,  allowing the weapon to deal precise damage regardless of the  target’s composition or protection. If the integrated probing  function is employed before firing, the resonator’s sonic  frequencies can be precisely tuned. Diffraction and refraction  resonators align sonic waves in specific patterns, while  linear and phased resonators focus the sonic energy through  specialized matrices for amplified output.</p>	43	14	73800	4d8 So	4	8	So	100	Deafen	40 charges	2	2	Boost 3d8, penetrating	ARM	50

1091	Dirge Cannon, Parametric	<p>Pirates are the most common users of dirge cannons. The  potbellied, shoulder-resting weapons cause a brief but intense  sound burst at frequencies and pressure sufficient to rupture  living cells while leaving inorganic objects unharmed. The result is  a weapon that can eliminate a starship’s crew without causing any  damage to the vessel or its cargo.

1092	Shout Projector, Riot	<p>Shout projectors amplify your speech to overwhelming or  destructive volume, and then project it in a cone. Words and  sheer sonic pressure in this cone can’t be ignored. All shout  projectors can be installed as armor upgrades (taking one  upgrade slot per hand needed to wield the weapon), allowing  the projectors to be used hands-free. That way, a user can   carry lethal weaponry, safety gear, or protest signage. Exhorter  shout projectors can be useful for crowd control with a lighter  touch. Damper and pacifier models are ostensibly for nonlethal  but more coercive applications, while the riot and crackdown  projectors are for heavy-handed use.</p>	43	17	304000	5d8 So	5	8	So	60	Demoralize	40 charges	4	2	Explode (15 ft.), integrated (4 slots), stun, unwieldy	ARM	50
1093	Sonic Bolter, Devastator	<p>The sound waves a sonic bolter produces tightly focus in a brief  but coherent line. This concentrated, low-frequency vibration  damages the body and jostles internal organs, causing dizziness,  pain, and slight nausea. Members of the Android Abolitionist  Front developed the light model upon discovering the effect  of a similar beam. Heavy, assault, and devastator bolters can  generate sufficient sound pressure to damage artificial and  unliving creatures.</p>	43	18	398000	6d12 So	6	12	So	90	Sicken	20 charges	2	2	Line, unwieldy	ARM	51

Dual and dual-plus multistage rifles use a two-stage firing  process, while triple and triple-plus multistage rifles employ a  three-stage process for added range.

When a solar flare grenade explodes, it sends out a lash of plasma. Creatures within the grenade’s area take the listed electricity and fire damage; each creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage. In addition, a solar flare grenade also sends out an electromagnetic pulse following the plasma wave. Within the same area, all technological objects that use charges, technological objects that do not use charges but are powered by electricity, and constructs with the technological subtype must each attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If a technological object with charges fails the save, it loses a number of charges equal to the grenade’s mark. If a technological object that is powered by electrical means other than charge fails the save, its functions are suppressed for a number of rounds according to the grenade’s type (see below).

The creatures to be summoned are set when the grenade is created, so you know what you’re getting when you buy, presupposing a scrupulous vendor.

This cloud provides concealment and corrodes creatures and materials within it. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the grenade’s item level) or be subject to the corrode critical hit effect.

1240	Wonder grenade (Hybrid)	<p>When it detonates, a wonder grenade releases a locus of magical uncertainty, which explodes into a strange effect once it makes contact with reality. When the grenade detonates, roll d% on the following table to determine the effect. (The GM is free to make up a similar effect based on your surroundings and circumstances.) If any effect of the grenade allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 15 + your key ability score modifier.<br/> These grenades pose a risk to the thrower. If you roll a 1, 3, or 5 on the attack roll, when the grenade lands but before it goes off, you teleport into the nearest open space in the blast radius. If no such space exists, you don’t teleport. <table> <tr><th>D%</th><th>WONDER EFFECT</th></tr> <tr><td>1–5</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius switches positions with another randomly determined creature in the blast radius (no save). No creature is placed in an area that is immediately hazardous to it (instead appearing in the closest safe space).</td></tr> <tr><td>6–10</td><td>Unlocked airlocks, appliance doors, doors, gates, lids, and windows open in the blast radius. Locks unlock if they are average or worse or controlled by a computer of tier 3 or lower. Magical locks that would open from a knock spell with a caster level check result of 25 or lower also unlock. After the blast unlocks a lock, whatever the lock was sealing opens. A creature can negate this effect on all objects it holds or wears with a successful Will saving throw.</td></tr> <tr><td>11–15</td><td>The blast radius becomes an area of zero gravity (Core Rulebook 404) for 4d4 rounds.</td></tr> <tr><td>16–20</td><td>The blast radius becomes the area of an explosive blast spell.</td></tr> <tr><td>21–25</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius must attempt a Reflex saving throw. Those that fail enter a state of reduced friction, which functions as if all surfaces they move on and all objects they hold are affected by a grease spell.</td></tr> <tr><td>26–30</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or its powered technological items cease to function for 1 round. A technological construct that fails the save is also staggered for 1 round. Unattended technological objects receive no saving throw and simply cease to function for 1 round.</td></tr> <tr><td>31–35</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius is affected as if by the ethereal jaunt spell for 1d4 rounds (no save).</td></tr> <tr><td>36–40</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius is affected as if by the invisibility spell for 4d4 rounds (no save).</td></tr> <tr><td>41–45</td><td>Thousands of UPBs erupt in the blast radius, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area (Reflex half). All but 1d4 × 10 UPBs are blown out of the blast radius, disappearing as they go.</td></tr> <tr><td>46–50</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude save or sprout 2d4 armlike appendages. Some of these arms lack anatomy consistent with their host. Only two are useful, like a kasatha’s extra arms. These limbs remain for 4d6 hours, but can also be removed with remove affliction (DC 20).</td></tr> <tr><td>51–55</td><td>One First World beast is teleported into the blast radius. Roll d% to determine the beast: 1–15—Huge beast (such as an elephant); 16–50—Large beast (such as a rhino); 51–100—Tiny beast (such as a squirrel). The beast appears in an unoccupied space, only 1 square of which must be in the blast radius. If the beast doesn’t have enough room to appear, a beast of the next smaller size appears. The beast is no one’s ally. It has a 25% chance to arrive hostile, but is otherwise indifferent until it reacts to the current situation. Use the summoning creatures rules (Alien Archive 244) to determine the creature’s statistics.</td></tr> <tr><td>56–60</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius can hear the surface thoughts of other creatures within 30 feet of it as a bewildering jumble alongside its own. This mind-affecting effect renders a creature shaken. A creature can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect. Otherwise, the effect lasts 1 minute. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw by 5 or more, that creature is no longer shaken and can focus the effect to function as detect thoughts, lasting for the remainder of the effect’s duration.</td></tr> <tr><td>61–65</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Will saving throw or suffer the mind-affecting delusion that it has increased one step in size. An affected creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Dexterity-based checks and saving throws, as well as to EAC and KAC. It is treated as squeezing when a creature of its imagined size would be squeezing, and it is unlikely to attempt to move into areas “too small” for it. If a creature believes it is constrained completely, it becomes paralyzed. This delusion lasts 2d4 rounds, but the creature can attempt a new saving throw once on any round when something happens that contradicts the false belief, such as being moved when it believes itself constrained.</td></tr> <tr><td>66–70</td><td>About 5,000 harmless, beautiful flying insects appear within the blast radius. This swarm functions like a fog cloud spell that disperses after 4d4 rounds.</td></tr> <tr><td>71–75</td><td>The center of the blast radius becomes a gravitational anomaly for an instant. Creatures in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dragged to the enarest space adjacent to the grenade's point of detonation. Any creature that collides with terrain that blocks line of effect or with another creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone.</td></tr> <tr><td>76–80</td><td>The grenade splits into 1d3+1 grenades, each of a kind determined randomly by rolling d%: 1–20—frag II, 21–34—screamer II, 35–50— shock II, 51–70—stickybomb II, 71–80—cryo I, 81–90—flash II, 91–100—incendiary II. Each grenade bounces as if its thrower had missed when throwing it. After each grenade lands at its new target, it detonates.</td></tr> <tr><td>81–85</td><td>About a thousand adorable, harmless Diminutive animals appear in the blast radius, covering the ground. This horde makes the blast radius difficult terrain, and at the end of every round, that area expands by 5 feet. Any item dropped or thrown into the area is knocked 1d4 squares in a random direction by the scrambling creatures, and knocked again when the area expands. The horde expands enough to disperse after 5 rounds.</td></tr> <tr><td>86–90</td><td>For 4d4 rounds, the blast radius fills with a windstorm (Core Rulebook 400).</td></tr> <tr><td>91–95</td><td>Each creature in the blast radius changes color to a random neon hue (no save). Roll 1d6: 1 red, 2 orange, 3 yellow, 4 green, 5 blue, or 6 violet. This effect is permanent but can be ended with a successful casting of remove affliction (DC 20), but if the spell fails, the target changes color again.</td></tr> <tr><td>96–100</td><td>The blast radius becomes a globe of vacuum (Core Rulebook 394), subjecting creatures initially caught in it to decompression. Air outside the vacuum rushes in to fill it after 4d4 minutes, unless the vacuum completely fills a sealed area, in which case it remains a vacuum even after 4d4 minutes have passed until the area is unsealed.</td></tr> </table></p>	52	10	2500	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (10 ft.; see text)	ARM	127

1260	Microbot grenade, mk 4 (Hybrid)	<p>When a microbot grenade detonates, the blast radius fills with microbots like those created by the microbot assault spell. The microbots consider only creatures in the blast radius to be the thrower’s enemies, and they do not discriminate between the thrower’s allies and enemies. The microbots last for 3 rounds. More advanced grenades create more dangerous microbots. The first time a creature leaves the area of the microbot cloud during a round, that creature takes an amount of magical piercing damage according to the grenade’s type. <ul> <li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 6):</strong> 1d6</li> <li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 9):</strong> 2d6</li> <li><strong>Mk 3 (Level 12):</strong> 3d6</li> <li><strong>Mk 4 (Level 15):</strong> 3d10</li> <li><strong>Mk 5 (Level 18):</strong> 4d12</li> </ul></p>	52	15	37000	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (5 ft.; see text)	ARM	126
1261	Pulse grenade III	<p>A pulse grenade emits a powerful EMP blast on impact whose damage and effects apply only to constructs with the technological subtype. Constructs reduced to 0 HP by a pulse grenade are not destroyed but simply nonfunctional until restored to 1 or more Hit Points. The EMP wave from a pulse grenade is not intense enough to affect augmentations, weapons, armor, or other technological gear</p>	52	15	37500	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (6d10 E, entangled 1d4 rounds, 20 ft.)

1263	Solar flare grenade V (Hybrid)	<p>Crafted using strange metals ejected by the sun and infused with magic from the Plane of Fire, solar flare grenades unleash the power of a star. When a solar flare grenade explodes, it sends out a lash of plasma. Creatures within the grenade’s area take the listed electricity and fire damage; each creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage. In addition, a solar flare grenade also sends out an electromagnetic pulse following the plasma wave. Within the same area, all technological objects that use charges, technological objects that do not use charges but are powered by electricity, and constructs with the technological subtype must each attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If a technological object with charges fails the save, it loses a number of charges equal to the grenade’s mark. If a technological object that is powered by electrical means other than charge fails the save, its functions are suppressed for a number of rounds according to the grenade’s type (see below). If a construct with the technological subtype fails the save, it is staggered for a number of rounds according to the grenade’s type (see below); such a construct can attempt an additional Fortitude save at the end of each round to shrug off the effect. <ul><li><strong>Solar Flare Grenade I:</strong> 1 round.</li> <li><strong>Solar Flare Grenade II:</strong> 1 round.</li> <li><strong>Solar Flare Grenade III:</strong> 2 rounds.</li> <li><strong>Solar Flare Grenade IV:</strong> 2 rounds.</li> <li><strong>Solar Flare Grenade V:</strong> 3 rounds.</li></ul></p>	52	15	20100	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (5d10 E & F, 20 ft.; see text)	DF02	39
1264	Summoning grenade, mk 5 (Hybrid)	<p>The explosion a summoning grenade generates is a realitywarping field that summons creatures as if you had cast a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144) of a spell level and caster level according to the grenade’s type. The creatures to be summoned are set when the grenade is created, so you know what you’re getting when you buy, presupposing a scrupulous vendor. When the grenade detonates, the summoned creatures appear immediately in unoccupied spaces, but a creature needs to have only 1 square of its space inside the blast radius. If a creature doesn’t have enough room to appear, it doesn’t. Summoned creatures treat you as their summoner.<br/> Summoning grenades come in the following types. <ul> <li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 3):</strong> 1st-level summon creature; caster level 3rd</li> <li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 6):</strong> 2nd-level summon creature; caster level 6th</li> <li><strong>Mk 3 (Level 9):</strong> 3rd-level summon creature; caster level 9th</li> <li><strong>Mk 4 (Level 12):</strong> 4th-level summon creature; caster level 12th</li> <li><strong>Mk 5 (Level 15):</strong> 5th-level summon creature; caster level 15th</li> <li><strong>Mk 6 (Level 18):</strong> 6th-level summon creature; caster level 18th</li> </ul></p>	52	15	16000	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (25 ft.; see text)	ARM	126

1268	Pheromone grenade, mk 4 (Hybrid)	<p>Though scientists understand little about how a vracinea’s paralyzing scent affects the brain, weapon designers across the galaxy have been inspired by its effects and have replicated them with custom hybrid grenades. When it bursts, a pheromone grenade deals no damage, instead dispersing a powerful cocktail of supercharged pheromones and magically modified mind-altering chemicals in the listed blast radius. Each creature in the radius that inhales the pheromones (which bypass even active environmental protections from a suit of armor) must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that fails its save is fascinated for a number of rounds equal to the grenade’s mark number as they gaze in wonder at sparkling trails that only they can see. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the effects of pheromone grenades for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>	52	16	26000	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (25 ft.; see text)	AA3	131

1274	Decoupler grenade V	<p>Although tripods can use other grenades, they are infamous for the decoupler grenades they produce internally. Other creatures in the galaxy, such as the weapon-dealing drow of Apostae, have replicated this horrid tech. A decoupler grenade produces a dense cloud of dark nanites. This cloud provides concealment and corrodes creatures and materials within it. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the grenade’s item level) or be subject to the corrode critical hit effect. A creature that inhales the nanites takes a –4 penalty to this saving throw.</p>	52	18	65000	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (15 ft., nanite cloud 1 minute, corrode 4d6)	AA3	119
1275	Diminisher grenade, mk 6 (Hybrid)	<p>When a diminisher grenade explodes, it twists space-time enough to accelerate the duration of magic and other effects in the blast radius. Any existing effect that has a duration measured in rounds has its remaining duration reduced by 2d4 rounds. If this reduction drops the remaining duration to 0 or less, the effect ends.<br/> A diminisher grenade affects only items and spells of the indicated level or lower or, for other effects, only those created by creatures with a CR or level equal to or lower than that listed. <ul> <li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 3):</strong> Item level or CR 3; spell level 1st</li> <li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 6):</strong> Item level or CR 6; spell level 2nd</li> <li><strong>Mk 3 (Level 9):</strong> Item level or CR 9; spell level 3rd</li> <li><strong>Mk 4 (Level 12):</strong> Item level or CR 12; spell level 4th</li> <li><strong>Mk 5 (Level 15):</strong> Item level or CR 15; spell level 5th</li> <li><strong>Mk 6 (Level 18):</strong> Item level or CR 18; spell level 6th</li> </ul></p>	52	18	51000	null	null	null	null	20	null	Drawn	1	L	Explode (20 ft.; see text)	ARM	126
